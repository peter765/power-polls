    "text": "Don't Tax Our Fallen Public Safety Heroes Update Act of 2017 \n\nThis bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to modify the tax exclusion for compensation paid to surviving dependents of a public safety officer who died as the direct and proximate result of a personal injury sustained in the line of duty. The bill extends the exclusion to compensation received under a program established under the laws of any local government (currently, only state programs). This modification must take effect as if it were included in the enactment of the law that created the original tax exclusion (the Don't Tax Our Fallen Public Safety Heroes Act)."
