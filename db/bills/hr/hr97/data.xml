This bill amends the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 to permit the compensation of congressional employees who have been issued employment authorization documents under the Department of Homeland Security's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program.

The program enables many unlawfully present aliens who came to the United States as children to be granted deferred action (a type of relief from removal which does not confer immigration status) and work authorization.</summary>
