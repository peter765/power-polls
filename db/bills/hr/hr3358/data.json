The summary of that version is repeated here.)\n\nHighlights: \n\nThis bill provides FY2018 appropriations for:\n\n the Department of Labor; most of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS); the Department of Education (ED); and several related agencies, including the Social Security Administration, the Corporation for National and Community Service, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, and the National Labor Relations Board. The bill does not include funding for the Food and Drug Administration, the Indian Health Service, and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, which are included within HHS, but considered in other appropriations bills.\n\nThe bill includes both discretionary and mandatory funding. The majority of the funding in the bill is mandatory funding for entitlement programs such as Medicaid and Supplemental Security Income that are funded in annual appropriations bills. These programs, known as appropriated entitlements, are included in annual appropriations bills, though the amounts provided for the programs are generally determined by authorizing statutes that control details of the programs such as eligibility rules and benefit levels.\n\nThe bill decreases discretionary funding compared to FY2017 levels. It also includes provisions that affect polices in areas such as:\n\n implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, abortion, human embryo research, fiduciary standards for providing investment advice for pension and retirement plans, collective bargaining, and needle exchange programs.
