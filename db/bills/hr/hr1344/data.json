The bill sets forth requirements for distribution of awarded amounts to local and tribal governments within states and for consultation with local and regional officials.\n\nThe Committee for Cyber Resiliency Grants is established to: (1) promulgate guidance for states to develop applications for such cyber resiliency grants; (2) provide DHS and states with recommendations regarding the approval of state plans or applications; and (3) evaluate, and report to Congress regarding, the progress of states in implementing plans."
