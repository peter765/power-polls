Exceptions are provided that allow terrestrial AM/FM radio broadcasts of a sound recording without the copyright owner's permission if: (1) a terrestrial AM/FM radio station pays royalties identical to those paid under the statutory license rates determined by Copyright Royalty Judges for eligible nonsubscription transmission services that apply to digital Internet radio streaming and webcasts; (2) the broadcast is of a religious service, by an educational terrestrial radio station, or by a low-power FM radio station; or (3) the broadcast is an incidental use. (Under current law, the exclusive right for the public performance of sound recordings extends only to digital audio transmissions, such as Internet and satellite radio broadcasts.)"
