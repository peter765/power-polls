The bill exempts the individuals from: (1) certain eligibility disqualification rules that apply to students enrolled at least half-time in an institution of higher education, and (2) SNAP work requirements.\n\nIf the individual is enrolled at least half-time in an institution of higher education that provides the individual with housing that lacks an individualized cooking facility, the bill also: (1) modifies the definition of \"food\" to permit SNAP benefits to be used for certain meals prepared and served by the institution, and (2) permits the individual to be treated as a separate household for the purpose of SNAP benefits."
