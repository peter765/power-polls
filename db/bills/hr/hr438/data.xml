This bill requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish a California New River restoration program for the New River that starts in Mexicali, Mexico, flows north into the United States through Calexico, passes through the Imperial Valley, and drains into the Salton Sea.

In carrying out the program, the EPA must: (1) implement projects, plans, and initiatives for the New River supported by the California-Mexico Border Relations Council; and (2) provide grants and technical assistance for coordinating restoration and protection activities.</summary>
