    "text": "Empowering Parents to Invest in Choice Act of 2017\n\nThis bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow the payment of qualified elementary and secondary education expenses from a tax-exempt qualified tuition program (known as a 529 plan). (Currently, such plans only pay qualified higher education expenses.)\n\nIncluded as qualified elementary and secondary education expenses are expenses for: (1) tuition, fees, academic tutoring, special needs services, books, and supplies; (2) room and board, uniforms, transportation, and supplementary items and services; and (3) and computer technology or equipment, including Internet access.\n\nThe bill also increases from $2,000 to $12,000 the limit on the amount that may be contributed to a tax-exempt Coverdell education savings account. The new contribution limit is adjusted for inflation in each taxable year beginning after 2014."
