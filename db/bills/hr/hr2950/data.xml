This bill requires the Department of the Interior and the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to ensure that a specified portion of the Land and Water Conservation Fund is made available each fiscal year for projects to: (1) maintain or increase public access to existing federal public land for hunting, fishing, or recreational shooting through the acquisition of rights-of-way or the acquisition of land through equal value land exchanges from willing owners; or (2) enhance, maintain, or restore access on existing roads, trails, or rights-of-way.

Interior and USDA must develop a priority list of such projects each year.</summary>
