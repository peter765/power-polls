This bill expresses U.S. policy that the U.S. citizens of Puerto Rico may choose whether Puerto Rico will become a state or a nation through a plebiscite pursuant to provisions of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014.

If the U.S. citizens of Puerto Rico reaffirm the territory's choice of statehood through such a plebiscite:

 federal laws that do not apply to Puerto Rico or that apply differently to the territory than to the several states shall be amended or repealed to phase in the equal treatment of Puerto Rico with the several states by January 3, 2025, the President's Task Force on Puerto Rico's Status shall submit a plan providing for such equal treatment to Congress and the President by 270 days after the enactment of this bill, Puerto Rico shall be considered a state for purposes of federal elections in November 2024, and Puerto Rico shall become a state and shall be admitted to the Union on equal footing with the other states on January 3, 2025.</summary>
