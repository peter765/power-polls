Arbuckle Project Maintenance Complex and District Office Conveyance Act of 2017

(Sec. 2) This bill directs the Department of the Interior to convey to the Arbuckle Master Conservancy District in Murray County, Oklahoma, all right, title, and interest of the United States in and to the Maintenance Complex and District Office of the Arbuckle Project.

The bill shields the federal government from being held liable by any court for damages arising out of any act, omission, or occurrence related to the complex and office, except for damages caused by acts of negligence by the government or government employees or agents prior to its conveyance.

After such conveyance: (1) the complex and office shall not be considered to be a part of a federal reclamation project; and (2) such district shall not be eligible to receive any benefits with respect to any facility comprising such complex and office, except benefits that would be available to a similarly situated person with respect to such a facility that is not part of a federal reclamation project.

 If the conveyance has not been completed within 12 months, Interior shall submit to Congress an explanation and the date by which the conveyance will be completed.</summary>
