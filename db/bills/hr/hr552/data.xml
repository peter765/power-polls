This bill prohibits the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of the Treasury, and the Department of Labor from implementing the rule entitled "Excepted Benefits; Lifetime and Annual Limits; and Short-Term, Limited-Duration Insurance" as the rule relates to short-term, limited duration insurance. The departments must use the definition of "short-term, limited duration insurance" in use immediately prior to publication of the rule. (The rule requires the duration of short-term, limited-duration insurance to be less than three months, including renewals. Previously, such insurance was required to expire less than 12 months after its effective date.)</summary>
