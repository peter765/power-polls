  <summary date="2017-03-30T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Medicaid Expansion Incentive Act of 2017 

This bill amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to provide additional federal Medicaid funding to states&#160;participating in&#160;Medicaid expansion under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The amount of additional funding shall be&#160;based upon the net reduction in federal funding&#160;for nonparticipating states.

The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services must publish annually,&#160;with respect to&#160;each nonparticipating state: (1) the amount of federal funding forgone by the state as a result of its nonparticipation, and (2) the number of individuals who would have gained coverage had the state participated.</summary>
