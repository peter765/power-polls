A state that elects to provide a reasonable period for an individual to provide such evidence may not receive payment for amounts expended on the individual's medical assistance during that period.\n\nIn FY2018-FY2026, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services,\u00a0using\u00a0the Medicaid Improvement Fund, shall pay a 90%\u00a0federal matching rate to eligible states for home- and community-based services furnished under a state Medicaid waiver to patients\u00a0who had been on\u00a0a waiting list for such services."
