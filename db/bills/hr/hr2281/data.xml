Border Enforcement Security Task Force Reauthorization Act of 2017

(Sec. 2) This bill amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to require the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), before establishing a Border Enforcement Security Task Force (BEST) unit, to apply risk-based criteria that takes into consideration specified factors, including:

 whether the area in which the unit would be established is significantly impacted by threats posed by transnational criminal organizations; the extent to which the unit would advance DHS's homeland and border security strategic priorities and related objectives; and whether departmental Joint Task Force operations would be enhanced, improved, or otherwise assisted by the unit. A BEST unit with a port security nexus must be composed of at least one member of each of: (1) the Coast Guard Investigative Service, and (2) the geographically-responsible Coast Guard Sector Intelligence Office.

The bill requires DHS to submit an annual report on the BEST program for the next five years, and such report must include:

 a description of the effectiveness of BEST in disrupting and dismantling transnational criminal organizations; an assessment of how BEST enhances information-sharing, including the dissemination of homeland security information, among federal, state, local, tribal, and foreign law enforcement agencies; a description of how BEST advances DHS's homeland and border security strategic priorities and effectiveness of BEST in achieving related objectives; and an assessment of BEST's joint operational efforts with departmental Joint Task Force operations.</summary>
