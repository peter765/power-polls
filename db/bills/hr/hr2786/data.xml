  <summary date="2017-06-06T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill amends the Federal Power Act to revise the criteria for a facility to qualify as a qualifying conduit hydropower facility.

Under current law, a hydropower facility must have a capacity that does not exceed five megawatts.This bill eliminates such requirement.

Additionally, the bill revises the timeframe for an entity to contest whether their hydroelectric facility meets the qualifying criteria.</summary>
