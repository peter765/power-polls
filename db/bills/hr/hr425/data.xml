This bill amends the Passport Act of 1926 to direct the Department of State to refuse to issue a passport to an individual who is a member of or affiliated with, or who has aided or provided material support to, a foreign terrorist organization.

 The State Department: (1) shall revoke a passport previously issued to any such individual; and (2) may, prior to revocation, issue a limited passport or limit a previously issued passport, but only for return travel to the United States.

 The State Department may issue or decline to revoke a passport for emergency, humanitarian, or law enforcement purposes.

 A person whose passport is denied, revoked, or limited may seek State Department review within 60 days of receiving notice of such action.

 The State Department shall report to Congress within 30 days regarding any such refusal or revocation.</summary>
