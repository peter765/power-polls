This bill amends the federal criminal code to revise post-employment lobbying restrictions on senior executive branch officials and employees.

Specifically, it imposes a five-year ban on communications by a former political appointee with the intent to influence officers or employees at their former executive branch agency or department.

The term political appointee includes certain senior political officials compensated on the Executive Schedule; limited term, limited emergency, and noncareer appointees in the Senior Executive Service; and employees in confidential or policy-determining positions in the excepted service.

Additionally, the bill amends the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938 to impose a lifetime ban on lobbying by a former political appointee on behalf of a foreign government or foreign political party.</summary>
