The bill bars the ATF from editing or erasing any such recording.\n\nThe ATF must make a digital video disc containing a copy of the recording available to: (1) a person requesting a copy who claims an ownership interest in such item, and (2) a defendant in a criminal proceeding involving such item.\n\nAn item which the ATF has determined is a firearm or ammunition shall not be admissible as evidence unless: (1) the ATF has complied with the requirements of this bill to make its digital video disc available, or (2) such compliance has been waived in writing by the person against whom the item is offered as evidence."
