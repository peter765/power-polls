This bill amends the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 to allow, under the National Flood Insurance Program, subsidized risk premium rates for flood insurance coverage on: (1) non-primary residences, and (2) business property.

In developing guidance and rate tables necessary to implement this Act, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) shall consult with "Write Your Own" companies that write and service standard flood insurance policies in their own names.</summary>
