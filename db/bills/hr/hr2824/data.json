    "text": "Increasing Opportunity through Evidence-Based Home Visiting Act\n\nThis bill amends title V (Maternal and Child Health Services) of the Social Security Act (SSAct) to reauthorize\u00a0through FY2022, and otherwise revise,\u00a0the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program.\n\n Under current law,\u00a0grantees were required,\u00a0after\u00a0three years\u00a0of program implementation, to demonstrate improvement in specified benchmark areas. The bill requires\u00a0grantees\u00a0to continue, in subsequent years,\u00a0to track and demonstrate improvement in applicable benchmark areas. A\u00a0grantee that fails to do so\u00a0must develop and implement a corrective action plan, subject to approval by\u00a0the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). HHS\u00a0shall terminate a\u00a0program grant made to\u00a0a grantee\u00a0that implements such a plan but continues to fail to demonstrate improvement.\n\nAs a condition\u00a0for receiving grant funds under the program, a state must conduct a statewide needs assessment by\u00a0October 1, 2019, and at least once every five years thereafter.\n\nA grantee may use\u00a0program grant funds\u00a0to support\u00a0a \"pay-for-outcomes initiative\"\u00a0(a performance-based grant, contract, or cooperative agreement, awarded by a public entity, in which a commitment is made to pay for improved outcomes that result in social\u00a0benefit and\u00a0public-sector cost savings).\n\nGrantees must provide matching funds under the program beginning in FY2020.\n\nHHS must designate data-exchange standards applicable to the program.\n\nThe bill also amends title XVI (Supplemental Security Income) (SSI) under the SSAct to\u00a0prohibit\u00a0the payment of SSI\u00a0benefits to an individual who is subject to an arrest warrant for: (1)\u00a0committing, or attempting to commit, a felony; or (2) violating a condition of parole or probation."
