  <summary date="2017-01-04T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Comprehensive Homes for Heroes Act of 2017

This bill requires the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to provide assistance to private nonprofit organizations and consumer cooperatives to expand the supply of supportive housing for very low-income veterans' families (families with incomes not exceeding 50% of the area median income).

The bill amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 to: (1) make housing rental vouchers available to all homeless veterans, regardless of medical condition; and (2) include veterans in public housing planning.

Veterans' benefits are excluded from income for purposes of HUD assisted housing rental determinations.

 HUD is required to: (1) make grants to nonprofit entities for technical assistance in sponsoring HUD housing projects for veterans, and (2) report annually to specified congressional committees and the Department of Veterans Affairs on HUD activities relating to veterans.</summary>
