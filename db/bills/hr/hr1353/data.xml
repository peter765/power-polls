Transparency in Technological Acquisitions Act of 2017

(Sec. 2) This bill amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to require the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to submit annually (currently, biennially):

 an update to its strategic five-year technology investment plan, and a report on the extent to which security-related technology acquired since the last issuance or update of the plan is consistent with the planned technology programs and projects identified for that security-related technology. The TSA shall also include information about acquisitions completed during the fiscal year preceding the fiscal year during which such report is submitted.

The TSA shall:

 report to Congress on any TSA equipment that is operating after the end of its life-cycle or the end of its useful life projection under the plan, and notify airports and airlines of any changes to the plan.</summary>
