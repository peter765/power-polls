Boosting Rates of American Veteran Employment Act or the BRAVE Act

 (Sec. 2) This bill authorizes the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), in awarding a contract for the procurement of goods or services, to give preference to offerors based on the percentage of the offeror's full-time employees who are veterans.

The VA is authorized to debar from VA contracting for at least five years any offeror determined to have willfully and intentionally misrepresented the veteran status of its employees. Such debarment shall include the debarment of all principals in the offeror for at least five years.

The VA shall: (1) commence debarment actions within 30 days after determining that the offeror misrepresented such veteran status, and (2) complete debarment actions within 90 days after such determination.</summary>
