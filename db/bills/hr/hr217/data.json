Exceptions are made for abortions where: (1) the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest; or (2) a physician certifies that the woman suffered from a physical disorder, injury, or illness that would place the woman in danger of death unless an abortion is performed, including a condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy. Hospitals are exempted unless they provide funds to non-hospital entities that perform abortions.\n\nHHS must include in an annual report: (1) information on grantees who performed abortions under the exceptions, and (2) a list of entities to which grant funds are made available."
