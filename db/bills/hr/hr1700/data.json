The program is renamed as simply the SCORE program.\n\nThe Small Business Administration (SBA) shall award a grant to the SCORE Association (or any successor group) to manage the program.\n\nBased on business experience and knowledge, a volunteer participating in the program shall:\n\n provide at no cost to individuals who own, or aspire to own, small business concerns personal counseling, mentoring, and coaching relating to the process of starting, expanding, managing, buying, and selling a business; and facilitate low-cost education workshops for individuals who own, or aspire to own, small business concerns. The SBA shall ensure that the program and each of its chapters develop and implement plans and goals to provide services more effectively and efficiently to individuals in rural areas, economically disadvantaged communities, and other traditionally underserved communities, including plans for electronic initiatives, web-based initiatives, chapter expansion, partnerships, and the development of new skills by participating volunteers.\n\nThe bill prescribes general privacy requirements for the disclosure of information of businesses assisted under such program.\n\nThe association shall:\n\n make use of online counseling, including by webinars and an electronic mentoring platform; study the future role of the program; and develop a strategic plan for how the program will evolve to meet the needs of small business concerns over the next five years."
