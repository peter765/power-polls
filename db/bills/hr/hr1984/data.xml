This bill requires the National Institutes of Health to expand, intensify, and coordinate programs for research on triple-negative breast cancer (the cells of these breast cancers are negative for estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, and excess HER2 protein).

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention must develop and disseminate to the public information regarding triple-negative breast cancer, including information on: (1) the incidence and prevalence of triple-negative breast cancer among women, (2) the elevated risk for minority women, and (3) the availability of a range of treatment options.

The Health Resources and Services Administration must develop and disseminate information on triple-negative breast cancer to health care providers.</summary>
