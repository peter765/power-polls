  <summary date="2017-06-28T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Veterans Acquiring Community Care Expect Safe Services Act of 2017 or the Veterans ACCESS Act

This bill directs the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to deny or revoke eligibility to provide non-VA health care services to veterans for any any health care provider that: (1) was removed from VA employment for violating VA policy relating to the delivery of safe and appropriate health care, (2) violated medical license requirements, (3) had a VA credential revoked on grounds that impact the provider's ability to deliver safe and appropriate health care, or (4) violated a law for which a prison term of more than one year may be imposed.

The VA may deny, revoke, or suspend a health care provider's eligibility to provide non-VA health care services based on a reasonable belief that such action is necessary to immediately protect the health or safety of veterans if: (1) the provider is under investigation by a state's medical licensing board, (2) the provider has entered into a settlement agreement for a disciplinary charge relating to the practice of medicine, or (3) the VA otherwise determines that such action is appropriate.

The VA shall suspend a health care provider's eligibility to provide non-VA health care services to veterans if such provider is suspended from serving as a VA medical provider.</summary>
