This bill amends the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (FCPA) to authorize private rights of action against persons that violate the FCPA's anti-bribery provisions, which prohibit giving things of value to foreign officials or political parties for purposes of obtaining or retaining business. A person that violates the FCPA's anti-bribery provisions shall be liable for up to treble damages to a securities issuer, domestic business concern, or U.S. person damaged by the violation.

A plaintiff must prove an FCPA anti-bribery violation by the defendant that: (1) prevented the plaintiff from obtaining or retaining business, and (2) assisted the defendant in obtaining or retaining such business.</summary>
