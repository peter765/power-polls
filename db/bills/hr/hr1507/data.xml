This bill directs the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to contract with an experienced non-government entity to conduct an annual survey, over a five-year period, to determine the experiences of veterans in obtaining hospital care and medical services at each VA medical facility.

Those surveys shall include questions relating to:

 a veteran's ability to obtain hospital care and medical services at the facility in a timely manner, the time between the date the veteran requests an appointment and the date the appointment is scheduled, the frequency with which scheduled appointments are canceled, and the quality of hospital care or medical services received. The VA shall make the results of the surveys publicly available on the VA's Internet website.</summary>
