The bill defines \"qualified methane conversion technology\" as a process for the molecular conversion of a fuel consisting principally of methane into hydrocarbons and the use of such hydrocarbons to replace or reduce the quantity of petroleum present in motor vehicle fuel and for the production of chemicals."
