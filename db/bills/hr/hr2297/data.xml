This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to exempt from the definition of "passive activity," for purposes of the passive loss tax rules, any qualified research activity carried on by a high technology research small business pass-thru entity.

The bill defines "high technology research small business pass-thru entity" as any domestic pass-thru entity if: (1) more than 75% of the entity's expenditures are paid or incurred in connection with qualified research that involves a process of experimentation conducted by the entity, or (2) more than 50% of the entity's expenditures constitute qualified research expenses. A high technology research entity is a small business if such entity has 250 or fewer full-time employees. The entity may not have aggregate gross assets in excess of $150 million at any time during the taxable year.</summary>
