The President is urged to promote women's participation in conflict prevention, in coordination with international partners.\n\n (Sec. 6) The Department of State and the Department of Defense (DOD) shall ensure that specified personnel receive training in conflict prevention, mitigation, and resolution and on other related topics.\n\n(Sec. 7) The State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) may establish guidelines for overseas U.S. personnel to consult with appropriate stakeholders regarding U.S. efforts to: (1) prevent, mitigate, or resolve violent conflict; and (2) enhance the success of mediation and negotiation processes by ensuring the meaningful participation of women.\n\n The State Department is urged to work with international, regional, national, and local organizations to increase the participation of women in international peacekeeping operations.\n\n(Sec. 8) The State Department, in conjunction with USAID and DOD and within a year of the first submission of the strategy, shall brief Congress on existing, enhanced, or newly established training carried out pursuant to this bill. The President, within two years of the submission of each strategy, shall report to Congress regarding its implementation."
