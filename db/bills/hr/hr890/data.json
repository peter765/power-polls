    "text": "Copyright Office for the Digital Economy Act\n\nThis bill establishes the U.S. Copyright Office as a separate independent agency in the legislative branch, to be headed by a director appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. (Currently, the Copyright Office is part of the Library of Congress [LOC] and is headed by the Register of Copyrights.)\n\nThe director's term of office is limited to 10 years without eligibility for reappointment. The director must appoint officers and employees responsible for administering the Copyright Office's technology and data systems.\n\nThe Copyright Office shall: (1) provide services in a manner that reflects technological needs and developments, and (2) promptly register copyright claims within a period that does not adversely impact the timely enforcement of rights and remedies.\n\nNo U.S. agency is authorized to require the Copyright Office to obtain an agency's approval before the Copyright Office submits legislative recommendations to Congress.\n\nCopyright owners may register their copyright claims by delivering examination copies of their works to the Copyright Office. The Copyright Office must then provide the LOC access to such examination copies and related data solely for the LOC's determination of whether to demand a deposit of the material or to otherwise engage with copyright owners regarding works of authorship that may be of curatorial and collection interest to the national library. The Copyright Office must also consult with the LOC on other matters of common interest.\n\nThe director must establish a Copyright Advisory Board to advise the Copyright Office and to provide information on emerging technology practices.\n\nThe Copyright Office must also: (1) submit a report on the future administration of mandatory deposit provisions and their application to the digital era, and (2) conduct studies to ensure that it has the technology and staff to establish and maintain a modern copyright system."
