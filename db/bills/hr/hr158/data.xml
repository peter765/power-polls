  <summary date="2017-01-03T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Corey Jones Act 

This bill amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to require an applicant under the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) program to certify that no law enforcement agency that receives COPS grant funds allows officers to conduct routine traffic stops while wearing plainclothes or while wearing plainclothes and in an unmarked police vehicle.

The Department of Justice may not waive this so-called plainclothes certification requirement.

If a law enforcement officer's conduct violates the plainclothes certification and results in serious injury or death of a person, then that person may bring a civil action against the law enforcement officer and any state, local, or tribal government that is a COPS program grantee and has direct authority over such officer.</summary>
