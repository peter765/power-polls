Veterans' participation shall be voluntary.\n\nThe VA shall contract with a qualified independent entity for comprehensive studies of the barriers encountered by veterans in receiving, and by administrators and clinicians in providing, complementary and alternative medicine services through the VA. Such studies shall be conducted through surveys of veterans and VA administrators and clinicians.\n\nThe VA shall carry out a three-year program awarding grants to public or private nonprofit entities to assess the feasibility and advisability of using wellness programs to complement the provision of mental health care to veterans and family members who are eligible for readjustment counseling from the VA."
