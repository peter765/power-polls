  <summary date="2017-09-05T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill provides $7.85 billion in FY2017 supplemental appropriations to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Small Business Administration (SBA) for disaster relief requirements, such as response and recovery efforts from Hurricane Harvey.

The bill provides $7.4 billion for FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund and $450 million for the SBA's Disaster Loans Program Account to remain available until expended.

The bill designates the funds as an emergency requirement and provides that the funds are only available if the President subsequently designates the funds and transmits the designation to Congress. (Emergency spending is exempt from discretionary spending limits and other budget enforcement rules.)</summary>
