The second five-year strategy shall contain related information, including: (1) the impact of such implementation on departmental operations and costs; and (2) the degree to which DHS established central DHS locations and co-located DHS components pursuant to the results of the required examination.\n\nThe implementation policies shall require components: (1) to certify to DHS that such components have complied with specified requirements before making any major real property decision or recommendation; and (2) acting through regional property managers, to report annually to DHS on underutilized space and identify space that may be made available for use by other components or federal agencies.\n\nDHS may grant an exception to the workspace standard usable square foot ranges for specific office locations at which a reduction or elimination of otherwise underutilized space would negatively impact a component's ability to execute its mission based on readiness performance measures or would increase the cost of such space.\n\nEach component shall identify a senior career employee to serve as the property manager for each geographic region. Each such manager shall: (1) serve as a single point of contact for DHS headquarters and other DHS components for real property matters, (2) provide data and any other support necessary for the DHS Regional Mission Support Coordinator strategic asset and portfolio planning and execution, and (3) provide to DHS annually data on each component's real property holdings.\n\nDHS shall: (1) monitor components' adherence to the regional real property strategies and implementation policies; (2) annually review the data submitted to ensure all underutilized space is properly identified; (3) review and, if appropriate, approve component certifications before such components may make any major real property decision; and (4) annually provide information to Congress and to the Inspector General of DHS on its real property portfolio.\n\nThe Inspector General shall review the information submitted and issue findings regarding the effectiveness of the implementation of the DHS-wide policy and oversight efforts of the management of real property facilities, personal property, mobile assets, requirement and DHS's other material resources."
