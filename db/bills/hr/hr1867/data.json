Eligibility is expanded to include all Alaska Native veterans who served between August 5, 1964, and May 7, 1975.\n\nAllotments may be selected from vacant federal lands or lands that have been selected or conveyed to the state of Alaska or an Alaska Native corporation, if the state or corporation relinquishes or conveys the land to the United States for allotment. Land may not be selected from: (1) the right-of-way of the TransAlaska Pipeline; (2) the inner or outer corridor of that right-of-way; or (3) a unit of the National Park System, a National Preserve, or a National Monument.\n\n An heir of a deceased eligible veteran, regardless of the cause of death, may apply for and receive an allotment.\n\n Alaska Native Vietnam veterans who selected an allotment of land before enactment of this bill and who were not conveyed the allotment before the enactment of this bill may reselect land."
