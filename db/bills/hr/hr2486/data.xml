  <summary date="2017-05-17T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Equity and Inclusion Enforcement Act

 This bill amends the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to allow private civil causes of action for disparate impact violations (to the same extent as intentional violations) of federal regulations of general applicability that prohibit discrimination on the ground of race, color, or national origin in programs or activities receiving federal financial assistance.

Education programs that receive financial assistance authorized or extended by the Department of Education (ED) must designate at least one compliance coordinator to carry out these nondiscrimination responsibilities and to investigate complaints.

The Department of Education Organization Act is amended to establish an ED-appointed Special Assistant for Equity and Inclusion within ED to: (1) promote, coordinate, and evaluate equity and inclusion programs, including the dissemination of information, technical assistance, and coordination of research activities; and (2) advise ED on matters relating to equity and inclusion.</summary>
