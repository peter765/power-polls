This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow certain businesses a general business tax credit for the cost of certain clean-fuel vehicle property and the use of clean-burning fuel if the businesses are located in areas designated as nonattainment areas under the Clean Air Act or have qualified clean-fuel vehicle property that is used substantially within a nonattainment area.

The bill also allows a new qualified hybrid motor vehicle tax credit for hybrid vehicles placed in service after December 31, 2016, by an eligible business if substantially all of the use of the vehicle is in a nonattainment area.</summary>
