This bill amends the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 to reduce the pay of Members of Congress for any year following a fiscal year in which the Office of Management and Budget determined that there was a federal budget deficit.

During the next calendar year that begins after a fiscal year in which there was a budget deficit: (1) congressional salaries must be reduced by the percentage by which outlays exceeded revenues for that fiscal year, except that the reduction may not exceed 15%; and (2) a cost-of-living adjustment is prohibited.</summary>
