To be appointed, a chiropractor must be eligible for licensure in a majority of the states or approved by a body acceptable to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). HHS and the Surgeon General must ensure that such chiropractors are trained, equipped, and otherwise prepared to fulfill public health and emergency response service responsibilities in the Commissioned Corps.\n\nThe President must appoint at least six chiropractors to the commissioned Regular Corps and the Ready Reserve Corps.\n\nThe Surgeon General must report to Congress on measures taken by the President, Surgeon General, and HHS to carry out this bill."
