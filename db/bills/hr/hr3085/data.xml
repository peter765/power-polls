  <summary date="2017-06-27T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill directs the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate to arrange for the collective award of a single Congressional Gold Medal to American military personnel who fought in defense of Bataan, Corregidor, Guam, Wake Island, and the Philippine Archipelago between December 7, 1941, and May 10, 1942, and who died or were imprisoned by the Japanese military in the Philippines, Japan, Korea, Manchuria, Wake Island, and Guam from April 9, 1942, until September 2, 1945, in recognition of their personal sacrifice and service to their country.

Following its award, the medal shall be given to the Smithsonian Institution where it shall be displayed and made available for research. The bill expresses the sense of the Congress that the Smithsonian Institution should make the medal available for display at other locations, particularly at locations associated with such American military personnel.</summary>
