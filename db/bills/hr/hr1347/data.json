(A \"fusion center\" serves as a focal point within the state and local environment for the receipt, analysis, gathering, and sharing of threat-related information between the federal government and state, local, tribal, territorial and private sector partners.)\n\nThe bill directs DHS to assess its efforts to support countering radicalization at the state, local, tribal, and territorial levels. Such assessment shall include:\n\n a cataloging of DHS efforts to assist state, local, tribal, and territorial governments in countering radicalization; a review of cooperative agreements between DHS and such governments relating to countering radicalization; and an evaluation of DHS plans and any potential opportunities to better support such governments that are in furtherance of DHS's countering radicalization objectives and consistent with all relevant constitutional, legal, and privacy protections. DHS shall notify Congress of the number of employees of state, local, tribal, and territorial governments with security clearances sponsored by DHS, including a detailed list of the agencies that employ such employees, the levels of clearance held, and whether such employees are assigned as representatives to state and major urban area fusion centers."
