This bill directs the U.S. Virgin Islands to award grants to public four-year institutions of higher education (IHEs) located in a state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, or Guam to cover the difference between in-state and out-of-state tuition and fees for students who have: (1) been domiciled in the Virgin Islands for at least the 12 months preceding their enrollment in the IHE; and (2) received on or after January 1, 2013, a secondary school diploma or its equivalent while domiciled there.

 The Government Accountability Office must monitor the program's effectiveness in expanding educational opportunities for such students.</summary>
