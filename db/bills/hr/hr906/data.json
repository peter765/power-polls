These reports shall not include any confidential medical record or the claimant's full Social Security number.\n\nUpon written request, and subject to payment for reasonable costs, a trust must\u00a0provide information related to payment from, and demands for payment from, the trust to any party to an action concerning liability for asbestos exposure."
