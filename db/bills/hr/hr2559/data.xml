This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to include a bicycle sharing system as a mass transit facility for purposes of the tax exclusion of employer-paid commuting expenses. The bill defines "bicycle sharing system" as a public transportation system: (1) consisting of a network of stations at which bicycles are made available to customers for commuting and short-term, point-to-point use within the network's service area; and (2) that is operated or authorized by a government agency or public-private partnership.</summary>
