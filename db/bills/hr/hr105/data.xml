This bill states that, in any case not involving negligent failure by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to investigate or monitor a fiduciary that results in fiduciary misuse of benefits, but in which any fiduciary misuses all or part of an individual's benefit paid to the fiduciary, the VA shall pay to the beneficiary or the beneficiary's successor fiduciary an amount equal to the amount of the misused benefit.

 An adverse determination by the VA of a veteran's mental capacity to manage VA monetary benefits may be appealed in accordance with provisions governing the Board of Veterans' Appeals and the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims.</summary>
