    "text": "This bill amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to modify, with respect to graduate medical education (GME) payments under the Medicare program,\u00a0provisions related to\u00a0\"approved medical residency training programs\" by: (1) specifying that such programs include osteopathic community residency training programs; and (2) replacing the requirement for such programs to include certain postgraduate training in geriatric medicine with a requirement for approval by a certified accrediting body.\n\nUnder current law, a \"foreign medical graduate\" is generally a resident who was not a graduate of\u00a0a school that meets the standards for accreditation by one of several specified accreditors. (Foreign medical graduates are subject to certain examination requirements for purposes of being counted as residents\u00a0with respect to Medicare GME payments.) The bill alters this definition such that a \"foreign medical graduate\" is a resident who is not a graduate of an accredited school.\n\nThe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services must certify at least two accrediting bodies for the purpose of accrediting medical residency training programs in allopathic and osteopathic medicine."
