  <summary date="2017-09-08T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Strengthening The Resiliency of Our Nation on the Ground Act or the STRONG Act.

 This bill requires the Office of Science and Technology Policy, with input from the Department of Homeland Security, to establish and chair an interagency working group with cabinet-level representation from all relevant federal agencies in order to: (1) provide a strategic vision of extreme weather resilience; (2) conduct a gap and overlap analysis of current and planned federal activities related to achieving short- and long-term resilience to extreme weather and its impacts on the United States, such as flooding and drought; and (3) develop a National Extreme Weather Resilience Action Plan.

The plan must include: (1) the establishment of an online, publicly available information portal to be used by federal agencies and other stakeholders that directs users to key data and tools to inform resilience-enhancing efforts and to build off and complement existing federal efforts; and (2) the identification of a coordinating entity to establish and maintain such portal and to coordinate the implementation of the plan and track its progress.</summary>
