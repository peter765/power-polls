This bill establishes within the Department of Labor's Employment and Training Administration a Dislocated Miners Assistance Program. The program shall contract with comprehensive career centers to:

 identify miners who have been dislocated from their employment in mining jobs across the United States; assess the skills, training, and education such miners need to find and hold new jobs; identify job training programs that would provide such training and education; and provide grants to eligible job training providers to recruit and train such miners and assist them in finding new employment. A comprehensive career center or job training provider eligible to receive a grant under this bill shall be a nonprofit organization with demonstrated success in coordinating or providing necessary training and education to enable dislocated miners to acquire marketable skills to find and hold jobs in areas where they live.</summary>
