(Sec. 3) Interior shall publish a notice containing the legal descriptions of such transferred land.\n\n The VA shall reimburse Interior for reasonable transfer costs, including survey costs.\n\n(Sec. 4) Upon a determination by the VA that all or a portion of such transferred land shall not be used for cemetery purposes, the VA shall: (1) notify Interior and transfer jurisdiction of the land back to Interior, and (2) be responsible for any decontamination costs necessary for restoration of the lands to the public lands."
