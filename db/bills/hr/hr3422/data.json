To\u00a0participate in the program, a\u00a0state\u00a0must require sufficiently rigorous assessments in awarding a teaching license or certification.\n\nIn carrying out the program, the Department of Education shall:\n\n create an electronic application process for eligible teachers who are licensed or certified in a participating state to apply\u00a0for teaching positions in\u00a0another participating state; require a participating state to recognize the teaching licensure or certification of each such teacher without the teacher having to complete additional licensure or certification requirements; ensure that a participating state maintains specified eligibility requirements; and provide technical assistance. A teacher seeking to participate in the program must submit an application containing: (1)\u00a0proof of active licensure or certification in a participating state, and (2) the teacher's results on specified assessments."
