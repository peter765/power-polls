This bill amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to establish a&#160;voluntary&#160;interstate teaching application program for participating states. To&#160;participate in the program, a&#160;state&#160;must require sufficiently rigorous assessments in awarding a teaching license or certification.

In carrying out the program, the Department of Education shall:

 create an electronic application process for eligible teachers who are licensed or certified in a participating state to apply&#160;for teaching positions in&#160;another participating state; require a participating state to recognize the teaching licensure or certification of each such teacher without the teacher having to complete additional licensure or certification requirements; ensure that a participating state maintains specified eligibility requirements; and provide technical assistance. A teacher seeking to participate in the program must submit an application containing: (1)&#160;proof of active licensure or certification in a participating state, and (2) the teacher's results on specified assessments.</summary>
