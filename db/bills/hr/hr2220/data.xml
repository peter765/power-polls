  <summary date="2017-04-27T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Military Pay Protection Act of 2017

This bill requires the Department of the Treasury, during a government shutdown, to make available to the Department of Defense (DOD) and to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), in the case of the Coast Guard, such amounts as necessary to continue to provide: (1) pay and allowances to members of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard, including reserve components, who perform active service during the shutdown and, at DOD's discretion, to DOD civilian and contractor personnel providing direct support to such members; and (2) funding necessary to prevent interruptions or delays in the performance of domestic disaster relief and recovery operations during the shutdown.

The bill defines "government shutdown" as any portion of a fiscal year for which funds have not been appropriated for such purposes.</summary>
