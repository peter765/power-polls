This bill amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to prohibit Members of Congress from: (1) receiving a discounted&#160;purchase price or a premium sales price in a securities transaction, or (2) purchasing a&#160;nonpublic offering of a covered security available on a U.S. or foreign exchange.

This prohibition shall not apply if the Member of Congress reasonably believes that the discount or premium was obtained in a manner generally available to the public.</summary>
