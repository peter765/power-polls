Improving Services for Older Youth in Foster Care Act

(Sec.2) This bill amends part E (Foster Care and Adoption Assistance) of title IV of the Social Security Act to revise the John H. Chafee Foster Care Independence Program to:

 authorize states electing to extend foster care eligibility up to age 21 to extend assistance and services to youths who have aged out of foster care but have not yet reached age 23, authorize redistribution of unexpended amounts among states that apply for additional program funds, allow states to make individuals eligible for participation in the educational and training voucher program through age 25 (but no more than 5 years), and modify congressional reporting requirements.</summary>
