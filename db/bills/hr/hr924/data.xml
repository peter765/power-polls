This bill amends the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council Act of 1978 to establish&#160;an Independent Examination Review Panel. The panel shall have exclusive jurisdiction of an appeal of a final material supervisory determination of a federal financial institutions regulatory agency.

A financial institution may request from a federal financial institutions regulatory agency a written determination of the agency's: (1)&#160;permission to take an action, and (2) interpretation of a law or regulation. An agency must respond to such a request within a specified timeframe.

The bill also establishes timeframes within which a&#160;federal financial institutions regulatory agency must: (1) conduct an exit interview with respect to the examination of a financial institution, and (2)&#160;provide a final examination report.</summary>
