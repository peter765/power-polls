This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to create tax-exempt small business start-up savings accounts to pay for the start-up expenses of a business that does not employ more than 50 full-time employees during a taxable year. Cash contributions to such accounts are allowed up to the lesser of $10,000 or the amount of compensation includible in the taxpayer's gross income for the taxable year.

(Start-up expenditures are paid or incurred in connection with: (1) investigating the creation or acquisition of an active trade or business; (2) creating an active trade or business; or (3) any activity engaged in for profit and for the production of income before the day on which the active trade or business begins, in anticipation of the activity becoming an active trade or business.)</summary>
