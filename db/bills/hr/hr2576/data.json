Cash contributions to such accounts are allowed up to the lesser of $10,000 or the amount of compensation includible in the taxpayer's gross income for the taxable year.\n\n(Start-up expenditures are paid or incurred in connection with: (1) investigating the creation or acquisition of an active trade or business; (2) creating an active trade or business; or (3) any activity engaged in for profit and for the production of income before the day on which the active trade or business begins, in anticipation of the activity becoming an active trade or business.)"
