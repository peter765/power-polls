This bill amends the Torture Victims Relief Act of 1998 to authorize FY2018-FY2019 appropriations to:

 the Department of Health and Human Services for grants to domestic treatment centers for the costs of services in the rehabilitation of victims of torture (including treatment of both physical and psychological effects), social and legal services, and research and training of health care providers outside of treatment centers or programs; and the President for grants to foreign treatment centers and programs for activities designed to treat victims for the physical and psychological effects of torture. The U.S. Agency for International Development is required to support indigenous foreign treatment centers and programs for torture victims in order to increase their capacities to train other local health care providers.</summary>
