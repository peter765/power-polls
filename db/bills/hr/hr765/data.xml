  <summary date="2017-01-31T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Increase Transportation Alternatives Investment Act of 2017

This bill directs the Department of Transportation (DOT) to ensure that states give preference, under the Surface Transportation Block Grant Program, to eligible projects that are located in areas that are undergoing extensive repair or reconstruction of transportation infrastructure, including federal-aid highways, federally owned roads open for public travel, passenger rail facilities, and public transportation facilities and that will provide transportation alternatives related to the closure of transportation infrastructure in such areas.

DOT shall: (1) carry out a competitive grant program to support community efforts to invest in transportation alternatives; and (2) give grant preference to projects located in such areas. Entities eligible for grants include state and local governments, metropolitan planning organizations, and rural planning organizations.

Grants may be used to plan for, facilitate, and provide initial support for:

 transportation demand management programs; carpool or telecommuting projects; and planning, design, acquisition of rights-of-way, construction, improvement, and management of streets, pathways, and public transportation facilities to facilitate expanded bicycle and pedestrian mobility and access.</summary>
