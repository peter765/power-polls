Entities eligible for grants include state and local governments, metropolitan planning organizations, and rural planning organizations.\n\nGrants may be used to plan for, facilitate, and provide initial support for:\n\n transportation demand management programs; carpool or telecommuting projects; and planning, design, acquisition of rights-of-way, construction, improvement, and management of streets, pathways, and public transportation facilities to facilitate expanded bicycle and pedestrian mobility and access."
