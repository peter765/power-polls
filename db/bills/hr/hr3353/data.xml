Requires Amtrak to report to Congress on waivers granted and overtime payments incurred.

(Sec. 151) Prohibits funds provided by this bill from being used for high speed rail in California or for the FRA to administer a grant agreement with the California High Speed Rail Authority that contains a tapered matching requirement. (A tapered match allows a project's federal share to vary from year to year as long as the final contribution of federal funds does not exceed the project's maximum authorized share.)
