(Qualified health plans are sold on health insurance exchanges, are the only plans eligible for premium subsidies, and fulfill an individual's requirement to maintain minimum essential coverage.) Currently, to be a qualified health plan, a catastrophic plan must enroll only individuals who are below age 30 and exempt from minimum essential coverage requirements."
