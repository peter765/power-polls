The bill also: (1) requires the Department of the Treasury to coordinate with other government officials in addressing tobacco tax evasion and conducting other enforcement activities, (2) amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to impose a civil penalty for the importation of tobacco products and cigarette papers and tubes by fraudulent means, and (3) provides for the enforcement of this bill in Indian tribal areas."
