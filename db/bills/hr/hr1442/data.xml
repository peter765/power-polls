  <summary date="2017-03-09T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Public Service Federal Eligibility Protection Act of 2017

This bill extends the eligibility for non-competitive appointment of any individual provided under Executive Order 11103 (relating to non-competitive appointment of eligible Peace Corps volunteers) or Executive Order 12721 (relating to non-competitive appointment of certain overseas employees), or of a VISTA volunteer under the Domestic Volunteer Service Act of 1973, by the number of days that such eligibility coincides with any federal hiring freeze.

The bill defines "federal hiring freeze" to mean the memorandum titled "Presidential Memorandum Regarding the Hiring Freeze" published on January 23, 2017, or any other substantially similar presidential action to prevent a federal agency from filling vacant federal civilian employee positions or creating new positions.</summary>
