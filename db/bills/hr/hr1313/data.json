This exemption applies to workplace wellness programs that comply with limits on rewards for employees participating in the program.\n\nWorkplace wellness programs may provide for more favorable treatment of individuals with adverse health factors, such as a disability.\n\nCollection of information about a disease or disorder of a family member as part of a workplace wellness program is not an unlawful acquisition of genetic information about another family member."
