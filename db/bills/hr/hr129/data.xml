 This bill amends the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 to prohibit the Department of Transportation (DOT) from authorizing any person to operate an unmanned aircraft system (drone) in the national airspace system as a weapon or to deliver a weapon against a person or property.

The bill permits DOT to establish exceptions to the prohibition for:

 private drones for recreational hunting and animal control; and public drones for operations conducted by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the Department of Defense, and certain governmental entities for national defense or in response to terrorism.</summary>
