    "text": "Critical Access and Rural Equity Act of 2017 or the CARE Act of 2017\n\nThis bill amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to specify that, for purposes of determining Medicare payment and reasonable costs for both inpatient and outpatient critical access hospital (CAH) services, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) shall recognize as allowable costs those\u00a0related to specified emergency, diagnostic, anesthetist, community health, and off-campus clinical services.\n\nFurthermore, in\u00a0determining payment and reasonable costs for both inpatient and outpatient CAH services, CMS shall not disallow payment to\u00a0a CAH on the basis that such payment offsets the cost of a current permissible health care-related tax imposed on and paid by the CAH.\u00a0CMS\u00a0must make specified payment adjustments to account for such a tax.\u00a0\n\nGenerally, under current law,\u00a0a facility\u00a0must be located beyond a specified driving distance from another hospital or facility in order to be designated as a CAH. The bill specifies that this requirement does not apply with respect to a CAH's off-campus provider-based clinic.\n\nCurrent law further requires a facility to provide\u00a0certain 24-hour emergency care services as a condition of designation as a CAH. The bill allows CMS to waive this requirement with respect to a facility that coordinates with a nearby\u00a0facility or hospital that provides such services."
