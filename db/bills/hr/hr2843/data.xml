  <summary date="2017-06-08T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Medicaid and Chip Quality Improvement Act of 2017

This bill amends titles XI (General Provisions) and XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to expand reporting requirements&#160;with respect to the quality of care provided&#160;under Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP).

Current law requires a state that contracts with a Medicaid managed organization&#160;to develop and implement a quality assessment and improvement strategy. The bill extends this requirement to state contracts with providers of&#160;comparable primary care case management services&#160;and other&#160;health care services under Medicaid.

With respect to adults eligible for Medicaid and children enrolled in Medicaid or&#160;CHIP, a state must report annually on quality measures identified by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS). Such reporting shall be stratified by service delivery system.

CMS shall establish a Medicaid Quality Performance Bonus fund to award states for high attainment and improvement on&#160;a core set of quality measures. A state must designate at least 75% of any bonus funds for the development and operation of quality-related initiatives that will directly benefit providers or managed care entities participating in, or under a waiver of, the state plan for medical assistance. A state may use&#160;the remainder of such&#160;funds for activities related to the goals and purposes of the state plan.</summary>
