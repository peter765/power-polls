    "text": "Adult Day Center Enhancement Act\n\nThis bill requires the Administration on Aging (AOA) to initiate a comprehensive survey of current adult day programs that provide care and support to individuals with neurological diseases or conditions such as multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, or traumatic brain injury. The AOA must identify ongoing successful adult day programs and which of these serve young adults with neurological conditions and develop best practices to guide the establishment of additional successful adult day programs.\n\nThe AOA must award grants for adult day programs that serve younger people with neurological conditions. An \"adult day program\" is defined as a program that provides comprehensive care and support services to individuals with neurological conditions and to their family caregivers and that may assist participants in ways that:\n\n maintain or improve their functional abilities or otherwise help them adjust to their changing functional abilities; prevent the onset of complications associated with severe forms of the condition; promote alternatives to placement in nursing homes; reduce the strain on family caregivers of individuals with neurological conditions; focus on supporting the emotional, social, and intellectual needs of a younger adult population; or address the needs of veterans with neurological conditions."
