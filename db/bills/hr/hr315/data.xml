Improving Access to Maternity Care Act

(Sec. 2) This bill amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) to identify maternity care health professional target areas, which are areas within health professional shortage areas that have a shortage of maternity care health professionals, for purposes of assigning maternity care health professionals to those areas.

HRSA must collect and publish data comparing the availability of and need for maternity care health services in health professional shortage areas and areas within those areas.</summary>
