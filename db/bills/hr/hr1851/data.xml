This bill amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to direct the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to develop and implement a fully automated electronic travel authorization system to collect biographical and other information in order to determine, before travel, the eligibility of, and any law enforcement or security risk of permitting, an alien to travel to Guam or the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.

DHS shall establish and collect a fee for the use of such system.

Such system shall be similar to the electronic system for travel authorization to the United States.</summary>
