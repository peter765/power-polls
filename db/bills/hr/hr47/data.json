    "text": "Effective and Humane Treatment of Youth Act of 2017 or Kalief's Law\n\nThis legislation amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to reauthorize the Juvenile Accountability Block Grant (JABG) program for FY2018-FY2022.\n\n It requires a state or local government that receives JABG funding to implement policies that, with respect to youth: (1) provide a right to speedy trial; (2) provide a right to timely bail consideration; and (3) restrict solitary confinement. The term \"youth\" means an individual who is 21 years of age or younger.\n\n Additionally, it requires a state or local government that receives funding under the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant program or the Community Oriented Policing Services program to implement policies and training on police-youth interaction.\n\n The legislation amends the federal criminal code to: (1) require youth custodial interrogations to be recorded; (2) prohibit youth solitary confinement, except as a temporary response to serious and harmful behavior; and (3) prohibit youth restraints during courtroom proceedings, except in certain circumstances.\n\nDOJ must report to Congress on youth solitary confinement, including: (1) types and conditions; and (2) number of instances broken down by age, race, ethnicity, gender, and unique circumstances.\n\nThe bill directs DOJ to award grants to states and local governments to record youth custodial interrogations.\u00a0"
