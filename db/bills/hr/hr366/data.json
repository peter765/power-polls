The summary of that version is repeated here.)\n\nDHS Stop Asset and Vehicle Excess Act or the DHS SAVE Act\n\n (Sec. 2) This bill amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to make the Under Secretary for Management of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) responsible for overseeing and managing vehicle fleets throughout DHS, including:\n\n ensuring that DHS components are in compliance with federal law, executive branch guidance, and DHS policy regarding fleet management and use of vehicles from home to work; developing and distributing a standardized vehicle allocation methodology and fleet management plan; ensuring that components formally document fleet management decisions; and approving component fleet management plans, vehicle leases, and vehicle acquisitions. The bill lists responsibilities of component heads regarding vehicle fleets, including developing and annually submitting to the Under Secretary a vehicle allocation tool and fleet management plan.\n\nThe Under Secretary shall:\n\n collect, on a quarterly basis, information regarding component vehicle fleets; seek to achieve a capability to collect automated information regarding component vehicle fleets; track and monitor component information, and review each component's vehicle allocation tool and fleet management plan, to ensure that component vehicle fleets are the optimal size and are cost effective; provide guidance on how component heads may achieve optimal fleet size; and as part of the annual budget process, review and make determinations regarding annual component requests for vehicle fleet funding. Beginning with FY2019, the Under Secretary and component heads may not approve a vehicle lease, acquisition, or replacement request, no DHS official with vehicle fleet management responsibilities may receive annual performance compensation in pay, and no senior executive service official of DHS whose office has a vehicle fleet may receive access to a car service, if such officials did not comply with vehicle allocation tool and fleet management plan requirements in the prior fiscal year.\n\nThe Under Secretary may determine the feasibility of operating a vehicle motor pool to permit components to share vehicles to reduce the number of excess DHS vehicles.\n\n(Sec. 3) The Inspector General of DHS shall: (1) conduct a review of implementation of vehicle allocation tool and fleet management plan requirements for FY2019, which shall include analysis of the effectiveness of such requirements with respect to cost avoidance, savings realized, and component operations; and (2) upon request, provide to specified congressional committees information regarding such review."
