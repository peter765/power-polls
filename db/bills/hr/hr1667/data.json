The trust agreement governing\u00a0such an assets\u00a0transfer must meet specified requirements.\n\nThe court may order such an assets transfer only if\u00a0it\u00a0determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that: (1) the transfer is necessary to prevent serious adverse effects on financial stability in the United States, (2) other specified requirements are met.\n\nThe bill imposes a temporary stay on actions to terminate or modify contracts with institutions that enter the Subchapter V bankruptcy process.\n\nMembers of the institution's board of directors shall have no liability to shareholders or creditors for a good faith filing of a petition to commence a Subchapter V bankruptcy case.\n\nThe bill specifies timelines with respect to the commencement of a case and the transfer of assets.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, among other federal regulatory agencies, shall have standing in a Subchapter V bankruptcy case.\n\nUnder specified conditions, a Subchapter V bankruptcy case may be converted into a case\u00a0in Chapter 7 bankruptcy (also known as \"liquidation\" bankruptcy).\n\n(Sec. 4) The bill amends the federal judicial code to require the Chief Justice of the United States\u00a0to designate at least 10 bankruptcy judges to be available to hear Subchapter V bankruptcy cases."
