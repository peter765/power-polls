(Sec. 2) This bill amends federal bankruptcy law to allow certain large financial institutions to elect a new "Subchapter V"&#160;bankruptcy process&#160;specific to such&#160;institutions.

(Sec. 3) Under the new process,&#160;a debtor institution may request the&#160;bankruptcy court&#160;to order&#160;the transfer of the debtor's assets to a newly formed bridge company. The trust agreement governing&#160;such an assets&#160;transfer must meet specified requirements.

The court may order such an assets transfer only if&#160;it&#160;determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that: (1) the transfer is necessary to prevent serious adverse effects on financial stability in the United States, (2) other specified requirements are met.

The bill imposes a temporary stay on actions to terminate or modify contracts with institutions that enter the Subchapter V bankruptcy process.

Members of the institution's board of directors shall have no liability to shareholders or creditors for a good faith filing of a petition to commence a Subchapter V bankruptcy case.

The bill specifies timelines with respect to the commencement of a case and the transfer of assets.

The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, among other federal regulatory agencies, shall have standing in a Subchapter V bankruptcy case.

Under specified conditions, a Subchapter V bankruptcy case may be converted into a case&#160;in Chapter 7 bankruptcy (also known as "liquidation" bankruptcy).

(Sec. 4) The bill amends the federal judicial code to require the Chief Justice of the United States&#160;to designate at least 10 bankruptcy judges to be available to hear Subchapter V bankruptcy cases.</summary>
