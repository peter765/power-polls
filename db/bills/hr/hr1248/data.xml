This bill amends the National Security Act of 1947 to prohibit the President from designating as an attendee or participant in the National Security Council (or in any meeting of the Principals Committee) any individual who threatens to destroy the government, including in speech or written form or through action.

The bill expresses the sense of Congress that a federal department or agency that issues a security clearance for an employee, including for an employee of the Executive Office of the President, should consider suspending the security clearance of an employee who threatens to destroy the state or to take hostile actions against the United States.</summary>
