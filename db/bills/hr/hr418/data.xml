This bill directs the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to carry out a three-year pilot program with community partners (private nonprofit organizations) to provide intensive community care coordination and supportive services to disabled veteran families who lack access to direct wellness services provided by the VA or other entities.

Such services may include:

 care coordination and case management services; outreach services; assistance in obtaining VA benefits, including vocational and rehabilitation counseling, employment and training service, educational assistance, and health care services; assistance in obtaining and coordinating the provision of other public benefits provided by government agencies or community partners, including marriage counseling, services for children, suicide prevention, substance abuse awareness and treatment, mental health awareness and treatment, financial counseling, anger management counseling, domestic violence awareness and prevention, employment assistance, transportation services, child care, housing counseling, preparing and updating family care plans, development of strategies for living with a veteran with post-traumatic stress disorder or traumatic brain injury, and accessing emergency financial assistance through philanthropic efforts; and direct services that are necessary to improve the well-being and address the needs of the disabled veteran families but that are otherwise unavailable through existing public or private programs.</summary>
