(Currently, such moneys are retained by the TSA for civil aviation security.)\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2005 is amended to replace the requirement that the TSA report annually to Congress on how unclaimed money is being used to provide civil aviation security with a requirement that the TSA report on the amount of money transferred to nonprofit organizations."
