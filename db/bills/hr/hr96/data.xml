 This bill directs the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to transfer annually, based on requests for proposals, unclaimed money recovered at airport security checkpoints to nonprofit organizations that operate multiple airport centers throughout the United States to provide places of rest and recuperation for Armed Forces members and their families. (Currently, such moneys are retained by the TSA for civil aviation security.)

The Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2005 is amended to replace the requirement that the TSA report annually to Congress on how unclaimed money is being used to provide civil aviation security with a requirement that the TSA report on the amount of money transferred to nonprofit organizations.</summary>
