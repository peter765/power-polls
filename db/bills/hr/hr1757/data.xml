  <summary date="2017-03-28T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Trauma-Informed Care for Children and Families Act of 2017

This bill establishes: (1) the Interagency Task Force on Trauma-Informed Care; (2) the National Law Enforcement Child and Youth Trauma Coordinating Center; (3) the Native American Technical Assistance Resource Center to provide trauma-informed technical assistance; and (4) Medicaid demonstration projects to test innovative, trauma-informed approaches for delivering early and periodic screening, diagnostic, and treatment services to eligible children. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention must encourage states to collect and report data on adverse childhood experiences.

The bill amends the Public Health Service Act, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act, and other laws to revise or establish provisions related to trauma, including provisions regarding the National Child Traumatic Stress Initiative, Performance Partnership Pilots, health professional shortage areas, and training of school personnel, court personnel, and health care providers. The Department of Education may award grants for the improvement of trauma support services and mental health care for children in educational settings.</summary>
