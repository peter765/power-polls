 (Sec. 2) This bill applies the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) to the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) during any period either such enterprise is under conservatorship or receivership of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. The FOIA exemption for trade secrets and commercial or financial information shall apply without regard to whether such information was obtained from a person outside Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac.

The FOIA requirements apply to records requests filed after the effective date of this bill that relate to any Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac record created before, on, or after the effective date.

(Sec. 3) To cover the cost of administering FOIA, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac shall establish fee schedules to collect fees from requests for records intended for a commercial use.</summary>
