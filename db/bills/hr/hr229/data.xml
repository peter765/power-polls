This bill amends the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act to permit the Native residents of each of the Native villages of Haines, Ketchikan, Petersburg, Tenakee, and Wrangell, Alaska, to organize as urban corporations and to receive certain settlement land.

These urban corporations may establish a settlement trust to promote the health, education, and welfare of the trust beneficiaries, and preserve the Native heritage and culture of their communities.</summary>
