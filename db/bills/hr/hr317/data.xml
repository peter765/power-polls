This bill requires the Securities and Exchange Commission, in establishing accounting principles or standards for purposes of the securities laws, to require that a repurchase-to-maturity transaction be treated as a secured borrowing in which the transferred asset serves as collateral.

A "repurchase-to-maturity transaction" is one in which: (1) a financial asset is transferred in exchange for cash, other financial assets, or letters of credit; and (2) the transferor and transferee agree that the transferee may return or redeem the transferred asset upon the asset's maturity.</summary>
