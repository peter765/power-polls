 This bill directs the Department of Labor to award grants to community colleges to: (1) analyze the demand for additional trained employees in their locality and the skills possessed by veterans who receive federal educational assistance and seek local employment; (2) carry out an existing, or implement a new, certificate or degree program that provides those veterans with training that addresses local demand for trained employees; and (3) facilitate the establishment of an advisory board to provide guidance to the training program and assist trained veterans in their pursuit of local employment.

 The advisory board shall be composed of local business representatives and an employee from the Department of Veterans Affairs.</summary>
