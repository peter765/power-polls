This bill requires the funding from the Financial Research Fund to be made available by appropriations Acts.\n\n The OFR must submit quarterly reports to Congress regarding its:\n\n finances; workforce; and actions taken to achieve the goals, objectives, and performance measures of the office. The OFR must provide a public notice and comment period of at least 90 days before issuing any proposed report, rule, or regulation.\n\n The bill expands the duties of the OFR to include:\n\n publishing an annual work plan; consulting with other federal departments and agencies with relevant expertise prior to preparing any public report with respect to a specified entity, class of entities, or financial product or service; and developing and implementing a cybersecurity plan. The Government Accountability Office must annually audit the cybersecurity plan and its implementation."
