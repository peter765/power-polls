  <summary date="2017-01-31T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Military Infrastructure Consolidation and Efficiency Act of 2017

This bill requires the Department of Defense (DOD) to: (1) develop a force structure plan (plan) for the Armed Forces based on a DOD assessment of threats to U.S. national security for FY2018-FY2038; (2) conduct a comprehensive inventory of military installations world-wide for each military department; and (3) submit a certification of whether the need exists for DOD to consolidate, close, or realign military installations (installation actions).

DOD may begin a round for the selection of installation actions only after Congress has had 90 days to consider such certification. The President may not begin such actions if Congress enacts a joint resolution of disapproval of the plan, inventory, or certification during such period.

DOD must certify that a round of installation actions will result in annual net savings within five years.

In developing its installation action recommendations, DOD shall consider an affected local government's approval of such an action.

The bill prescribes final selection criteria for such recommendations, which shall include military value criteria.

The bill establishes an independent Military Infrastructure Consolidation and Efficiency Commission of 2019 if: (1) DOD certifies that the need exists for a round for the selection of installation actions, and (2) Congress does not enact such a joint resolution of disapproval within the prescribed 90 days. The bill provides for: (1) commission review of, and authority to make changes to, DOD recommendations; and (2) presidential review of commission recommendations for the consolidation, closure, and realignment of military installations inside the United States.

DOD may provide economic adjustment assistance to an affected community.

DOD shall establish a new Field Activity to act as the executive agent for the management and disposal of excess real property resulting from installation actions. The General Services Administration shall delegate to DOD the authority to utilize excess property and dispose of surplus property located at a military installation closed or realigned under this Act.

The bill sets forth: (1) provisions governing the transfer of property located at an affected installation, (2) the responsibilities of the redevelopment authorities for such installations, and (3) the duties of the Department of Housing and Urban Development s regarding how redevelopment plans address the needs of the homeless.

The bill provides for establishment of the Military Infrastructure Consolidation and Efficiency 2019 account to be used for approved installation actions.

 This bill shall be the exclusive authority for selecting or carrying out installation actions inside the United States until April 15, 2020, excluding specified closures and realignments carried out for reasons of national security or a military emergency.</summary>
