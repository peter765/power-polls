FEMA shall select jurisdictions to host a workshop series from cities that: (1) have received or are receiving funding under the Urban Area Security Initiative, and (2) have requested to be considered. Individuals from state and local jurisdictions and emergency response providers in cities selected shall be eligible to participate in the series.\n\nFEMA must report, each year for next six years, to all participating agencies and to Congress regarding key findings or themes, lessons learned, and best practices identified."
