Improving Fusion Centers' Access to Information Act

(Sec. 2) This bill amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to direct the Department of Homeland Security State, Local, and Regional Fusion Center Initiative to: (1) conduct outreach to state, local, and regional fusion centers to identify any gaps in information sharing and consult with other federal agencies to develop methods to address such gaps; and (2) identify federal databases and datasets that are appropriate to address any such gaps, for inclusion in the information sharing environment and coordinate with the appropriate federal agency to deploy or access such databases and datasets.

 A fusion center serves as a focal point within the state and local environment for the receipt, analysis, gathering, and sharing of threat-related information between the federal government and state, local, tribal, territorial, and private sector partners.</summary>
