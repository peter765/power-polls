This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow employers a business-related tax credit of $1,500 for hiring&#160;an apprentice who has not attained age 25&#160;at the close of the taxable year or $1,000 for an apprentice who has attained age 25. The bill allows such credit for no more than&#160;two taxable years with respect to any apprentice. An "apprentice" is an employee who is employed in an officially-recognized apprenticeable occupation pursuant to an apprentice agreement registered with the Office of Apprenticeship of the Employment and Training Administration of the Department of Labor or a recognized state apprenticeship agency.</summary>
