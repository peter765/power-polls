 This bill extends federal recognition to the Little Shell Tribe of Chippewa Indians of Montana. The tribe and its members become eligible for services and benefits provided by the United States to federally recognized tribes and their members, without regard to the existence of a reservation or the location of the residence of any member.

The service area of the tribe is considered to be the area comprised of Blaine, Cascade, Glacier, and Hill Counties, Montana.

 The tribe, as a condition of receiving recognition, services, and benefits, must submit to the Department of the Interior, and maintain, a membership roll.

Interior must take into trust for the benefit of the tribe 200 acres of land within the tribe's service area to be used for a tribal land base.</summary>
