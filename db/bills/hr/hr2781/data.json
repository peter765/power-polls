A \"sufficient number\" means between two and enough to maximize the percentage of orders entered into by the VA with such businesses, as determined by the VA.\n\nIf such representation within a category is not sufficient, the VA shall: (1) consult with the General Services Administration to increase the number of such concerns awarded contracts under that category, or (2) stop awarding orders under that category of the initiative."
