This bill directs the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to certify that sufficient numbers of small businesses owned and controlled by veterans, and of small business owned by veterans with service-connected disabilities, are represented within each category of supplies or services for which a suite of contracts has been awarded under the Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative. A "sufficient number" means between two and enough to maximize the percentage of orders entered into by the VA with such businesses, as determined by the VA.

If such representation within a category is not sufficient, the VA shall: (1) consult with the General Services Administration to increase the number of such concerns awarded contracts under that category, or (2) stop awarding orders under that category of the initiative.</summary>
