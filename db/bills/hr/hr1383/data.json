(The Korean Constabulary undertook internal security tasks on behalf of the U.S. military government in Korea and the South Korean people from November 1945 to January 1949.)\n\nThe Department of State shall seek to urge the South Korean government to: (1) reexamine Article 16-9 of South Korea's Military Pension Act, and (2) expeditiously locate the records and remains of 7,235 combat dead of the Korean Constabulary. (Article 16-9 of South Korea's Military Pension Act denies veterans of the Korean Constabulary coverage for their service prior to the establishment of South Korea.)\n\nThe Department of Defense shall submit a report that: (1) describes potential awards and recognition for officers and enlisted men of the Korean Constabulary, and (2) examines the possibility of establishing new awards and recognition for those individuals if no awards or recognition currently apply.\n\nThe bill includes among persons who are eligible for interment in national cemeteries any veteran of the Korean Constabulary who, at the time of death, resided in the United States and was a citizen of, or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence in, the United States."
