The bill prohibits such right to transfer the computer program from being waived by any agreement.\n\nAny right to receive modifications to such a computer program relating to security or error correction that applied to the owner of the machine or product shall apply to the person to whom the machine or product and the copy of the computer program are transferred.\n\nNothing in this bill should be construed to permit the owner to retain an unauthorized copy of the computer program after such a transfer."
