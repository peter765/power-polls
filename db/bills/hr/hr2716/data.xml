This bill defines "state homes" to include homes established by federally recognized Indian tribes for veterans who, by reason of disability, are incapable of earning a living.

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) shall pay those tribes for the hospital, nursing home, domiciliary, and medical care they provide to veterans in those homes.

Those tribes shall be eligible for VA grants for the construction of state homes.</summary>
