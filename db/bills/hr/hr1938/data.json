The returns must be submitted no later than the date of the meeting of the Senate and House of Representatives to count the electoral votes for President and Vice President.\n\nThe bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to permit the IRS to disclose the required tax returns to the chairs and ranking minority members of the two congressional committees if the President-elect does not submit the returns by the deadline.\n\nThe President-elect may redact from the returns any: (1) Social Security number, (2) taxpayer identification number, (3) account identification number, and (4) name of any dependent of the taxpayer. The IRS must make the redactions if it discloses the returns.\n\nThe chairs and ranking members of the two committees may disclose any information contained in a tax return submitted pursuant to this bill."
