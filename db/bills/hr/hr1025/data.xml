  <summary date="2017-02-13T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Eyes on the Courts Act of 2017

This bill requires the presiding judge of a U.S. appellate court, including the Supreme Court, to permit the photographing, electronic recording, audio-visual coverage, broadcasting, televising, or streaming on the Internet of appellate court proceedings to or for the public, unless the judge determines, upon a motion of a party or the judge, that it would constitute a violation of the due process rights of a party or is not in the interests of justice.

The Judicial Conference of the United States may promulgate mandatory guidelines with respect to the management and administration of such photographing, recording, broadcasting, televising, or streaming.

The presiding judge of each appellate court may promulgate rules and disciplinary measures for the courtroom use of any form of media or media equipment and the acquisition or distribution of any of the images or sounds obtained in the courtroom.</summary>
