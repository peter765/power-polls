SEC Regulatory Accountability Act

(Sec. 2) This bill amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to direct the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to:

 before issuing a regulation under the securities laws, identify the nature and source of the problem that the proposed regulation is designed to address; adopt a regulation&#160;only upon a reasoned determination that its benefits justify its costs; identify and assess available alternatives to any regulation; and ensure that any regulation is accessible, consistent, written in plain language, and easy to understand. In determining the costs and benefits of a proposed regulation, the SEC shall consider its impact on investor choice, market liquidity, and small businesses.

In addition, the SEC shall: (1) periodically review its existing regulations to determine if they are outmoded, ineffective, insufficient, or excessively burdensome; and (2) in accordance with such review, modify, streamline, expand, or repeal them.

Whenever it adopts or amends a rule that is&#160;"major" (in terms of economic impact), the SEC shall state in its adopting release: (1)&#160;the regulation's purposes and intended consequences, (2)&#160;metrics for measuring the regulation's economic impact, (3) the assessment plan to be used to assess whether the regulation has achieved its stated&#160;purposes, and (4) any foreseeable unintended or negative consequences of the regulation.</summary>
