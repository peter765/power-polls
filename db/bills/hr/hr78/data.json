In determining the costs and benefits of a proposed regulation, the SEC shall consider its impact on investor choice, market liquidity, and small businesses.\n\nIn addition, the SEC shall: (1) periodically review its existing regulations to determine if they are outmoded, ineffective, insufficient, or excessively burdensome; and (2) in accordance with such review, modify, streamline, expand, or repeal them.\n\nWhenever it adopts or amends a rule that is\u00a0\"major\" (in terms of economic impact), the SEC shall state in its adopting release: (1)\u00a0the regulation's purposes and intended consequences, (2)\u00a0metrics for measuring the regulation's economic impact, (3) the assessment plan to be used to assess whether the regulation has achieved its stated\u00a0purposes, and (4) any foreseeable unintended or negative consequences of the regulation."
