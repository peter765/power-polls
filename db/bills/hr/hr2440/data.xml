This bill directs the President: (1) within 90 days after first assuming office, to submit to the Department of the Treasury an initial report detailing any private business transaction with a foreign government conducted by the President during the previous 10 years; and (2) each month thereafter, to submit a report detailing any private business transaction between businesses affiliated with the President and foreign governments during that month.

A "business transaction" is defined as any transaction of more than $10,000 in relation to any private businesses or investments listed in the President's financial disclosure reports, including any report submitted pursuant to the Ethics in Government Act of 1978.

Such reports shall be made available on Treasury's public website.

A violation of this bill shall constitute a high crime and misdemeanor for purposes of the Constitution's impeachment provision.</summary>
