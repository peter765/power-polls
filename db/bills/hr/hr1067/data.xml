  <summary date="2017-02-15T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Build up Illegal Line Defenses with Assets Lawfully Lifted Act of 2017

This bill amends the federal judicial code to require the Department of Justice to: (1) report annually on the total amount of funds deposited into the Department of Justice Asset Forfeiture Fund that are derived from Mexican cartels, and (2) study how to derive more such funds from Mexican cartels.

50% of the funds derived from Mexican cartels must be made available to construct physical barriers and roads to deter illegal border crossings into the United States.

Additionally, the bill amends the federal criminal code to prohibit the release of seized currency or contraband that belongs to or supports a foreign, illegal trafficking organization while a civil forfeiture action is pending.</summary>
