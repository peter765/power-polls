  <summary date="2017-04-04T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Property Tax Reduction Act of 2017

This bill amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to reduce&#160;federal Medicaid funding&#160;for certain states that require political subdivisions to contribute funds towards medical assistance. Specifically, the bill applies to states that received, for FY2016, disproportionate share hospital (DSH) allotments&#160;greater than&#160;six times the national average. (DSHs are hospitals that receive additional payment under Medicaid for treating a large share of low-income patients.)

Excepted from the bill are&#160;contributions that: (1) are required from a political subdivision that has a population&#160;greater than 5 million and imposes a local income tax upon its residents, or (2) were required for administrative expenses as of January 1, 2017.</summary>
