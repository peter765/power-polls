Specifically, the bill applies to states that received, for FY2016, disproportionate share hospital (DSH) allotments\u00a0greater than\u00a0six times the national average. (DSHs are hospitals that receive additional payment under Medicaid for treating a large share of low-income patients.)\n\nExcepted from the bill are\u00a0contributions that: (1) are required from a political subdivision that has a population\u00a0greater than 5 million and imposes a local income tax upon its residents, or (2) were required for administrative expenses as of January 1, 2017."
