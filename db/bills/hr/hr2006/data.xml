VA Procurement Efficiency and Transparency Act

(Sec. 2) This bill requires the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), with respect to any VA contract that is reported in the Federal Procurement Data System, to record the amount of any cost or price savings realized by using competitive procedures in awarding such contract.

(Sec. 3) The VA shall make available and use on a VA-wide basis the standardized procurement templates used by the Central Office of the VA, the Veterans Health Administration, the Veterans Benefits Administration, and the National Cemetery Administration. Such templates may be customized to address particular procurement situations.</summary>
