All fees received shall be set aside in a special account and be available for the administration and enforcement of the program, including registering vehicles, issuing permits and vehicle identification stickers, and personnel costs.\n\nThe following vehicles may use Highway 209 without a fee or permit requirement:\n\n local school buses; fire, ambulance, and other safety and emergency vehicles; and commercial vehicles along specified segments of the highway."
