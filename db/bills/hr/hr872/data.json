A device may not be sold if the manufacturer violates these notification requirements.\n\nRapid assessment tests intended to ensure the proper reprocessing of reusable medical devices are defined as medical devices. The FDA must publish a list of the types of rapid assessment tests for which premarket notification must include validated instructions for use and validation data."
