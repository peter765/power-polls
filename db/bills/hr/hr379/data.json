Such program shall provide mental health and psychosocial support for children from such communities, with a particular focus on services to survivors of sexual slavery.\n\nThe State Department shall establish a program to provide training on trauma-informed care to psychologists, social workers, and physical therapists based in Iraq, Syria, or any country that hosts Yazidi, Christian, Shabak, or Turkmen refugees.\n\nFunds for such State Department programs are transferred from amounts available for assistance to Egypt."
