  <summary date="2017-01-09T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Justice for Yazidis Act

This bill states that Syrian and Iraqi nationals who are members of a religious minority in their country of origin: (1) shall be classified as refugees of special humanitarian concern, (2) shall be eligible for priority-2 refugee resettlement processing, and (3) may apply directly to the U.S. refugee admissions program.

No alien shall be denied the opportunity to apply for admission under this bill solely because he or she: (1) qualifies as an immediate relative, (2) is eligible for any other immigrant classification, or (3) was referred to apply for refugee admission by a U.S. nonprofit organization.

Each such alien who, after June 1, 2014, and before the date of the enactment of this bill, was denied refugee status may reapply for such status.

 The Department of State shall: (1) submit and implement a plan to expedite priority-2 refugee processing, and (2) submit annual program reports through 2020.

The Department of Defense shall report on U.S. military efforts in Islamic State (ISIS)-controlled regions to incorporate the rescue and care of religious or minority group captives.

The State Department shall establish a program to provide health care and psychosocial support for members of the Yazidi, Christian, Shabak, and Turkmen communities displaced by ISIS. Such program shall provide mental health and psychosocial support for children from such communities, with a particular focus on services to survivors of sexual slavery.

The State Department shall establish a program to provide training on trauma-informed care to psychologists, social workers, and physical therapists based in Iraq, Syria, or any country that hosts Yazidi, Christian, Shabak, or Turkmen refugees.

Funds for such State Department programs are transferred from amounts available for assistance to Egypt.</summary>
