 This bill directs the Department of Transportation (DOT) to establish a transformational infrastructure competitive grant program to award grants to state and local governments, transit agencies, and port authorities for certain public transportation projects (including water infrastructure projects) that will significantly impact a metropolitan area, a region, or all of the United States.

The federal share of project costs is 100%.

The iron, steel, and manufactured goods used in projects funded under this bill must have been produced in the United States, except in specified circumstances.

DOT shall coordinate with relevant federal departments and agencies to ensure that environmental reviews are made in a manner that accelerates delivery of such projects.

The Department of the Treasury shall establish a Nation Building Here at Home Financing Initiative.</summary>
