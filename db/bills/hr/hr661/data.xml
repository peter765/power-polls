  <summary date="2017-01-24T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Employee Fairness and Relief Act of 2017

This bill permits a health insurer that had in effect health insurance coverage in the small group market in 2013 to offer that coverage outside of health insurance exchanges. That coverage is treated as a grandfathered health plan and thus fulfills an individual's requirement to maintain minimum essential coverage.</summary>
