    "text": "Financial CHOICE Act of 2017\n\n (Sec. 2) This bill repeals provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and other laws.\u00a0Any rule that was issued or revised\u00a0pursuant to a provision repealed by the bill\u00a0is nullified.\n\nTITLE I--ENDING \"TOO BIG TO FAIL\" AND BANK BAILOUTS\n\nSubtitle A--Repeal of the Orderly Liquidation Authority\n\n(Sec. 111) The bill repeals the orderly liquidation authority of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The FDIC's orderly liquidation authority, as established under the Dodd-Frank Act, allows the FDIC to\u00a0liquidate a\u00a0failing financial institution\u00a0if the institution's\u00a0imminent failure threatens financial stability.\n\nSubtitle B--Financial Institution Bankruptcy\n\n (Sec. 121)\u00a0Newly established\u00a0provisions\u00a0related to\u00a0Chapter 11 bankruptcy, which generally involves the reorganization of\u00a0a debtor's assets and debts, shall apply to covered financial corporations (certain large and complex financial institutions, as defined by the bill).\n\nUnder specified circumstances, a court may convert a covered financial corporation's Chapter 11 bankruptcy case into a case under Chapter 7 bankruptcy (also known as \"liquidation\" bankruptcy).\n\n(Sec. 122) The bill amends the federal bankruptcy code to establish Chapter 11 bankruptcy procedures specific to covered financial institutions.\n\n Specified federal financial regulatory agencies may appear and be heard in such cases.\n\n In making decisions in such cases,\u00a0a court may consider\u00a0effects\u00a0on\u00a0financial stability in the United States.\n\n(Sec. 123) The Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court shall designate judges to hear Chapter 11 bankruptcy cases involving covered financial corporations.\n\nSubtitle C--Ending Government Guarantees\n\n(Sec. 131) The bill repeals the FDIC's authority, under the Dodd-Frank Act, to guarantee bank debt during times of severe economic distress.\n\n(Sec. 132) Current law generally requires the FDIC to utilize the least-costly method when using the Deposit Insurance Fund to resolve failing banks; however, in an exception to this requirement, the FDIC may take other action or provide assistance to avoid or mitigate serious adverse effects on economic conditions or financial stability.\u00a0The bill repeals this exception.\n\n(Sec. 133) The Exchange Stabilization Fund may not be used for the establishment of a guaranty program for any nongovernmental entity.\n\nSubtitle D--Eliminating Financial Market Utility Designations\n\n (Sec. 141) The bill repeals the authority of the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) to designate financial market utilities (i.e., payment, clearing, and settlement systems) as \"systemically important\" (also known as \"too big to fail\").\u00a0\u00a0Under current law,\u00a0entities so designated are subject to additional regulatory restrictions.\n\nSubtitle E--Reform of the Financial Stability Act of 2010\n\n (Sec. 151) The bill repeals FSOC's authority to\u00a0designate non-bank financial institutions as \"systemically important.\"\n\n In addition, the bill eliminates the Office of Financial Research, which is tasked under current law with supporting FSOC through data collection and analysis.\n\n The bill repeals: (1) provisions related to the\u00a0authority of the Federal Reserve Board (FRB)\u00a0to supervise and take enforcement action against\u00a0non-bank financial companies; (2) the prohibition against management interlocks in certain financial companies (i.e.,\u00a0the prohibition against a management official serving simultaneously in two unaffiliated organizations); and (3) specified early-remediation requirements applicable to non-bank financial companies in financial distress.\n\nWith respect to FSOC, the bill modifies\u00a0council membership, voting procedures, open meetings requirements, and duties. In addition, the bill subjects FSOC to the congressional appropriations process.\n\nThe bill exempts qualifying banking organizations from certain standards\u00a0related to\u00a0proposed acquisitions.\n\nIn addition, the bill modifies procedures for: (1)\u00a0the submission and federal review of \"living wills\" (i.e., companies' plans for rapid and orderly resolution in the event of financial distress or failure); and (2) the stress testing of bank holding companies.\n\nThe FRB may not, on an emergency basis, approve an application that would cause a company to become a bank holding company, unless the application involves the company's acquisition of a bank that is critically undercapitalized.\n\nSpecified concentration limits applicable to large financial firms under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 shall apply only to banking organizations.\n\n(Sec. 152) A federal banking agency may not establish an operational-risk capital requirement for banking organizations unless the requirement: (1) is based on, and is appropriately sensitive to,\u00a0current risks; (2)\u00a0is determined under a forward-looking assessment of potential losses; and (3) allows\u00a0certain adjustments.\n\nTITLE II--DEMANDING ACCOUNTABILITY FROM WALL STREET\n\nSubtitle A--SEC Penalties Modernization\n\n(Sec. 211) The bill amends the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Investment Company Act of 1940, and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to increase civil monetary penalties that may be imposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for various securities laws violations. With respect to a failure to comply with an injunction or order relating to a violation of one of these laws, each day shall be deemed a separate offense.\n\n(Sec. 212) The bill amends the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 to increase civil monetary penalties that\u00a0the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) may impose upon registered public accounting firms or associated persons for violations of specified securities laws, board rules, or professional standards.\n\n (Sec. 216) The Government Accountability Office (GAO) must report on the SEC's use of its authority to impose civil monetary penalties.\n\nSubtitle B--FIRREA Penalties Modernization\n\n(Sec. 221) The bill amends the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA), and other laws, to increase civil and criminal monetary penalties for specified violations involving financial institutions.\u00a0\n\nTITLE III--DEMANDING ACCOUNTABILITY FROM FINANCIAL REGULATORS AND DEVOLVING POWER AWAY FROM WASHINGTON\n\nSubtitle A--Cost-Benefit Analyses\n\n(Sec. 312) In general, a federal financial egulatory agency must include, in a notice of proposed rulemaking, a regulatory analysis as specified by the bill.\u00a0Except\u00a0at the direction of Congress, a\u00a0federal regulatory agency may\u00a0not publish a notice of final rulemaking if the agency, in its analysis, determines that the quantified costs of the proposed rule exceed its quantified benefits.\n\n (Sec. 314) A federal financial regulatory agency must make available on its website the data, methodologies, and assumptions underlying its required regulatory analysis such that its results can be substantially reproduced.\n\n(Sec. 315) A federal financial regulatory agency's chief economist must submit to Congress, and make available on\u00a0the agency's\u00a0website, a report that examines the economic impact of a regulation that is the subject of a notice of final rulemaking.\n\n(Sec. 316) Each federal financial regulatory agency must periodically submit to Congress, and make available on its website: (1) a plan to modify, streamline, expand, or repeal existing regulations so as to make the agency more effective or less burdensome in achieving its regulatory objectives; and (2) a progress report on the steps that the agency has taken to implement\u00a0that\u00a0plan.\n\n(Sec. 317) A person that is aggrieved by a regulation may bring an action for judicial review of agency compliance with the bill's requirements with respect to regulatory analysis.\n\n(Sec. 318) The bill establishes a Chief Economists Council, consisting of federal financial regulatory agencies' chief\u00a0economists,\u00a0and tasks the council to report annually to Congress on specified issues related to regulations.\n\n Subtitle B--Congressional Review of Federal Financial Agency Rulemaking\n\n(Sec. 331) Before a rule may take effect, the\u00a0promulgating federal financial regulatory agency must report to Congress and the GAO\u00a0on any cost-benefit analysis of the rule and\u00a0other specified\u00a0information.\n\nIn general, a\u00a0\"major rule\" (i.e., a rule with significant economic impact) promulgated by a federal financial regulatory agency shall not take effect unless Congress enacts a joint resolution of approval, as described by the bill.\n\n(Sec. 332) The bill\u00a0establishes procedures\u00a0for congressional approval of major rules.\n\n(Sec. 333) The bill establishes procedures for congressional disapproval of rules other than major rules.\n\n (Sec. 335) No action or omission under this subtitle of the bill shall be subject to judicial review, except that a court may determine whether an agency has completed the necessary requirements for a rule to take effect.\n\n(Sec. 336) A rule shall take effect at a time determined by the promulgating federal financial regulatory agency if: (1) the rule establishes or modifies a program related to hunting, fishing, or camping;

The SEC must also extend the requisite holding period from one year to three years.\n\nAn issuer may not include in its proxy materials (i.e., documents outlining a public company's methods and procedures) a shareholder proposal submitted by a person acting as a proxy or otherwise acting on behalf of a shareholder.\n\n(Sec. 845) The SEC may not require\u00a0that a\u00a0proxy solicitation, in an election\u00a0of members of an issuer's board of directors, be made using a single ballot.\n\n (Sec. 846) An issuer of municipal securities shall not be required to retain a municipal advisor prior to issuing such securities.\n\n(Sec. 847) Current law exempts from certain internal-control evaluation requirements\u00a0an issuer that is either an accelerated filer or a large accelerated filer. The bill instead exempts from such requirements an issuer that either: (1) has total market capitalization of less than $500 million, or (2) is a depository institution with assets below $1 billion.\n\n(Sec. 848) The SEC must adhere to specified timeframes with respect to\u00a0granting or rejecting an application for an exemption from requirements of the Investment Company Act of 1940. If the SEC denies such an application, it must provide the applicant with a written explanation and an opportunity for a hearing.\n\n(Sec. 849) Current law requires an issuer to establish a policy for the recovery of certain erroneously awarded executive compensation. The bill specifies that this requirement applies only with respect to recovery from an executive officer who had control or authority over the financial reporting\u00a0that resulted in the error.\n\n(Sec. 850) The SEC may exempt a person from registration requirements applicable to a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSO)\u00a0if: (1) such requirements create a barrier to entry into the market for, or impede competition among,\u00a0NRSOs; or (2) such an exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and is consistent with the protection of investors.\n\n(Sec. 851) Under current law, the SEC's Office of Credit Ratings is required to conduct annual examinations of each NRSO. The bill\u00a0specifies that such examinations\u00a0shall be\u00a0risk-based and removes the requirement that they be conducted at least annually.\n\n(Sec. 852) Current law requires each\u00a0NRSO to disclose to the SEC certain information related to the NRSO's credit rating procedures and methodologies. The bill prohibits the SEC from: (1) mandating the specific organization of such disclosures, or (2) requiring that such disclosures include references to statutory or regulatory requirements.\n\n (Sec. 853) The bill repeals\u00a0the requirement for each NRSO to include, with any credit rating it issues,\u00a0an attestation affirming that: (1) no part of the rating was influenced by\u00a0other business activities, (2) the rating was based\u00a0solely on the merits of the instruments being rated, and (3) the rating was an independent evaluation of the instrument's risks and merits. The bill also repeals the requirement for each NRSO to include in its annual internal-controls report an attestation of its chief executive officer.\n\n(Sec. 854) The bill limits the applicability of certain look-back review requirements for NRSOs.\n\n (Sec. 856)\u00a0A person who sells or markets the products or services of an NRSO\u00a0may provide certain material information relating to credit ratings to a person who determines or monitors credit ratings,\u00a0so long as the information is not intended to influence credit-rating determinations.\n\n (Sec. 857) The bill repeals provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that:\n\n authorize the SEC to engage in investor testing; authorize the SEC to restrict the use of mandatory pre-dispute arbitration; provide for equal treatment of SRO rules; with respect to short sales, establish specified public-disclosure and investor-notification requirements; prohibit manipulative short sales of securities; lessen requirements with respect to pleading state of mind in a private action against an NRSO; apply the fair disclosure rule (which requires publicly traded companies to disclose material information to all investors at the same time) to NRSOs; subject credit rating agencies to expert liability; require an issuer to make specified disclosures; prohibit covered financial institutions with assets in excess of $1 billion from using certain incentive-based payment arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks; require the SEC's Division of Trading and Markets to\u00a0employ a staff of compliance examiners; allow the SEC to issue specified rules regarding proxy access; allow the SEC to require a registered national securities association to establish a fee to fund the Governmental Accounting Standards Board; direct the SEC to issue rules to increase the transparency of securities-lending information available to brokers, dealers, and investors; and establish a grant program to support state efforts to protect seniors from fraudulent marketing. (Sec. 858) In general, an investment adviser shall not be subject to registration and reporting requirements under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 with respect to the provision of investment advice relating to a private equity fund.\n\n (Sec. 860) The bill expands the\u00a0category of investors that\u00a0may be\u00a0considered \"accredited investors\" for purposes of participating in private offerings.\n\n (Sec. 862) The bill repeals provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that require specified disclosures related to: (1)\u00a0conflict minerals originating in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, (2) mine safety violations, (3) and payments to foreign governments by resource extraction issuers.\n\nSubtitle C--Harmonization of Derivatives Rules\n\n(Sec. 871) The SEC and the CFTC must review specified rules relating to swap markets.\n\n(Sec. 872) The bill exempts swap transactions between affiliates from swap rules issued by the SEC or the CFTC.\n\nTITLE IX--REPEAL OF THE VOLCKER RULE AND OTHER PROVISIONS\n\n(Sec. 901) The bill lifts the moratorium on the FDIC's provision of deposit insurance to industrial banks, credit-card banks, and certain trust banks.\n\nThe bill eliminates the FRB's supervisory authority over securities holding companies.\n\nThe bill repeals the \"Volcker Rule,\" which prohibits banking agencies from engaging in proprietary trading or entering into certain relationships with hedge funds and private equity funds.\n\nCurrent law prohibits an underwriter, placement agent, initial purchaser, or sponsor of an asset-backed security from engaging, within one year\u00a0after the first closing of the sale of the asset-backed security, in a transaction that would involve a material conflict of interest. The bill repeals this prohibition.\n\nTITLE X--FED OVERSIGHT REFORM AND MODERNIZATION\n\n(Sec. 1001) The bill amends the Federal Reserve Act to require the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to, after each meeting, submit to Congress a Directive Policy Rule\u00a0for open market operations that includes\u00a0specified information and meets certain other requirements.\n\n(Sec. 1002) The bill restricts the type of public communications that FOMC members and staff may make\u00a0regarding financial developments or monetary policy during a \"blackout period\" (i.e., a period extending from approximately one week\u00a0before an FOMC meeting to approximately one day afterwards).\n\n(Sec. 1003) The FOMC must make full transcripts of its meetings available to the public.\n\n(Sec. 1004) The bill alters the membership of the FOMC.\n\n(Sec. 1005) The Chairman of the FRB must testify to Congress quarterly, rather than semiannually.\n\n (Sec. 1007) The bill: (1)\u00a0subjects members and employees of the\u00a0FRB to\u00a0additional ethics standards as well as specified restrictions on financial interests, transactions and outside employment; (2) requires such members and employees to disclose all brokerage accounts and other accounts in which they have a financial interest; and (3) requires the\u00a0FRB to publicly disclose salary information\u00a0with respect to\u00a0certain staff.\n\n(Sec. 1008) The bill limits the FRB's emergency-lending authority to cases in which the financial stability of the United States is threatened. Moreover, the FRB may not exercise its emergency-lending authority without the affirmative votes of at least nine Federal Reserve bank presidents.\n\nThe FRB must issue specified rules regarding: (1)\u00a0the collateral required to secure loans made under its emergency-lending authority, and (2) the minimum interest rate on loans made under its emergency-lending authority.\n\nA borrower shall be ineligible to borrow from an emergency-lending program unless the borrower is certified by the\u00a0FRB and federal banking regulators as solvent.\n\n (Sec. 1010) The bill removes specified limitations on GAO audits of the FRB and Federal Reserve banks.\n\n(Sec. 1011) The bill establishes the Centennial Monetary Commission and tasks the commission with studying specified issues related to monetary policy.\n\nTITLE XI--IMPROVING INSURANCE COORDINATION THROUGH AN INDEPENDENT ADVOCATE\n\n(Sec. 1101) The bill: (1)\u00a0eliminates the Federal Insurance Office, which is tasked under the Dodd-Frank Act to monitor the insurance sector; and (2) establishes the Office of the Independent Insurance Advocate, which is authorized\u00a0under the bill to\u00a0provide coordination and consultation with respect to insurance matters.\n\n(Sec. 1102) Before an agreement regarding prudential measures involving insurance or reinsurance may take effect, Treasury and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative must publish and make available for public\u00a0comment the proposed text of the agreement."
