TITLE I--ENDING "TOO BIG TO FAIL" AND BANK BAILOUTS

Subtitle A--Repeal of the Orderly Liquidation Authority

Subtitle B--Financial Institution Bankruptcy

 (Sec. 121)&#160;Newly established&#160;provisions&#160;related to&#160;Chapter 11 bankruptcy, which generally involves the reorganization of&#160;a debtor's assets and debts, shall apply to covered financial corporations (certain large and complex financial institutions, as defined by the bill).

Under specified circumstances, a court may convert a covered financial corporation's Chapter 11 bankruptcy case into a case under Chapter 7 bankruptcy (also known as "liquidation" bankruptcy).

(Sec. 122) The bill amends the federal bankruptcy code to establish Chapter 11 bankruptcy procedures specific to covered financial institutions.

Subtitle C--Ending Government Guarantees

(Sec. 131) The bill repeals the FDIC's authority, under the Dodd-Frank Act, to guarantee bank debt during times of severe economic distress.

(Sec. 132) Current law generally requires the FDIC to utilize the least-costly method when using the Deposit Insurance Fund to resolve failing banks; however, in an exception to this requirement, the FDIC may take other action or provide assistance to avoid or mitigate serious adverse effects on economic conditions or financial stability.&#160;The bill repeals this exception.

 (Sec. 141) The bill repeals the authority of the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) to designate financial market utilities (i.e., payment, clearing, and settlement systems) as "systemically important" (also known as "too big to fail").&#160;&#160;Under current law,&#160;entities so designated are subject to additional regulatory restrictions.

Subtitle E--Reform of the Financial Stability Act of 2010

 (Sec. 151) The bill repeals FSOC's authority to&#160;designate non-bank financial institutions as "systemically important."

With respect to FSOC, the bill modifies&#160;council membership, voting procedures, open meetings requirements, and duties. In addition, the bill subjects FSOC to the congressional appropriations process.

The bill exempts qualifying banking organizations from certain standards&#160;related to&#160;proposed acquisitions.

In addition, the bill modifies procedures for: (1)&#160;the submission and federal review of "living wills" (i.e., companies' plans for rapid and orderly resolution in the event of financial distress or failure); and (2) the stress testing of bank holding companies.

The FRB may not, on an emergency basis, approve an application that would cause a company to become a bank holding company, unless the application involves the company's acquisition of a bank that is critically undercapitalized.

Specified concentration limits applicable to large financial firms under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 shall apply only to banking organizations.

(Sec. 152) A federal banking agency may not establish an operational-risk capital requirement for banking organizations unless the requirement: (1) is based on, and is appropriately sensitive to,&#160;current risks; (2)&#160;is determined under a forward-looking assessment of potential losses; and (3) allows&#160;certain adjustments.

In implementing the safe harbor, the SEC must prohibit a self-regulatory organization (SRO) from maintaining or enforcing a rule that would prevent a member from: (1) publishing or distributing a covered investment fund research report solely because the member is also participating in a registered offering of the fund,&#160;or (2) participating in a registered offering of a covered investment fund solely because the member has published a research report about the fund.

Specifically, the bill applies to a venture&#160;capital fund&#160;that has less than $50 million in aggregate capital contributions and uncalled committed capital. Under current law, a venture capital fund is considered to be an investment company if it has more than 100 investors.

Subtitle B--Eliminating Excessive Government Intrusion in the Capital Markets

 (Sec. 841) The bill nullifies the "fiduciary duty" rule finalized by the Department of Labor on April 8, 2016. In accordance with that rule, advisers to retirement investors are fiduciaries that must comply with specified standards for impartial conduct.

(Sec. 842) The bill exempts asset-backed securities that are comprised wholly of nonresidential mortgages from certain risk-retention requirements.

(Sec. 843) Current law requires shareholder approval with respect to an issuer's compensation of executives no less frequently than once every three years. The bill instead requires such approval only when there has been a material change to executive compensation from the previous year.

(Sec. 844) Current regulations allow the resubmission of a shareholder proposal that has been previously included in the issuer's proxy materials if, when the proposal was last included, it received less than a specified percentage of the vote; this percentage, which&#160;varies&#160;depending upon the number of times a proposal has been previously submitted, represents the minimum threshold at which resubmission is permissible. The bill directs the SEC to increase this threshold.

In addition, the SEC must revise its regulations with respect to the holding requirement for a shareholder to be eligible to submit a shareholder proposal to an issuer for inclusion in the issuer's proxy statement.&#160; Specifically, the SEC must eliminate the option for a shareholder to satisfy the holding requirement by holding a certain dollar amount (under current regulations, $2,000). The SEC must also extend the requisite holding period from one year to three years.

An issuer may not include in its proxy materials (i.e., documents outlining a public company's methods and procedures) a shareholder proposal submitted by a person acting as a proxy or otherwise acting on behalf of a shareholder.

(Sec. 845) The SEC may not require&#160;that a&#160;proxy solicitation, in an election&#160;of members of an issuer's board of directors, be made using a single ballot.

(Sec. 847) Current law exempts from certain internal-control evaluation requirements&#160;an issuer that is either an accelerated filer or a large accelerated filer. The bill instead exempts from such requirements an issuer that either: (1) has total market capitalization of less than $500 million, or (2) is a depository institution with assets below $1 billion.

(Sec. 848) The SEC must adhere to specified timeframes with respect to&#160;granting or rejecting an application for an exemption from requirements of the Investment Company Act of 1940. If the SEC denies such an application, it must provide the applicant with a written explanation and an opportunity for a hearing.

(Sec. 849) Current law requires an issuer to establish a policy for the recovery of certain erroneously awarded executive compensation. The bill specifies that this requirement applies only with respect to recovery from an executive officer who had control or authority over the financial reporting&#160;that resulted in the error.

(Sec. 850) The SEC may exempt a person from registration requirements applicable to a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSO)&#160;if: (1) such requirements create a barrier to entry into the market for, or impede competition among,&#160;NRSOs; or (2) such an exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and is consistent with the protection of investors.

(Sec. 851) Under current law, the SEC's Office of Credit Ratings is required to conduct annual examinations of each NRSO. The bill&#160;specifies that such examinations&#160;shall be&#160;risk-based and removes the requirement that they be conducted at least annually.

(Sec. 852) Current law requires each&#160;NRSO to disclose to the SEC certain information related to the NRSO's credit rating procedures and methodologies. The bill prohibits the SEC from: (1) mandating the specific organization of such disclosures, or (2) requiring that such disclosures include references to statutory or regulatory requirements.

 (Sec. 853) The bill repeals&#160;the requirement for each NRSO to include, with any credit rating it issues,&#160;an attestation affirming that: (1) no part of the rating was influenced by&#160;other business activities, (2) the rating was based&#160;solely on the merits of the instruments being rated, and (3) the rating was an independent evaluation of the instrument's risks and merits. The bill also repeals the requirement for each NRSO to include in its annual internal-controls report an attestation of its chief executive officer.

(Sec. 854) The bill limits the applicability of certain look-back review requirements for NRSOs.

 (Sec. 856)&#160;A person who sells or markets the products or services of an NRSO&#160;may provide certain material information relating to credit ratings to a person who determines or monitors credit ratings,&#160;so long as the information is not intended to influence credit-rating determinations.

 (Sec. 857) The bill repeals provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that:

 authorize the SEC to engage in investor testing; authorize the SEC to restrict the use of mandatory pre-dispute arbitration; provide for equal treatment of SRO rules; with respect to short sales, establish specified public-disclosure and investor-notification requirements; prohibit manipulative short sales of securities; lessen requirements with respect to pleading state of mind in a private action against an NRSO; apply the fair disclosure rule (which requires publicly traded companies to disclose material information to all investors at the same time) to NRSOs; subject credit rating agencies to expert liability; require an issuer to make specified disclosures; prohibit covered financial institutions with assets in excess of $1 billion from using certain incentive-based payment arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks; require the SEC's Division of Trading and Markets to&#160;employ a staff of compliance examiners; allow the SEC to issue specified rules regarding proxy access; allow the SEC to require a registered national securities association to establish a fee to fund the Governmental Accounting Standards Board; direct the SEC to issue rules to increase the transparency of securities-lending information available to brokers, dealers, and investors; and establish a grant program to support state efforts to protect seniors from fraudulent marketing. (Sec. 858) In general, an investment adviser shall not be subject to registration and reporting requirements under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 with respect to the provision of investment advice relating to a private equity fund.

 (Sec. 860) The bill expands the&#160;category of investors that&#160;may be&#160;considered "accredited investors" for purposes of participating in private offerings.

 (Sec. 862) The bill repeals provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that require specified disclosures related to: (1)&#160;conflict minerals originating in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, (2) mine safety violations, (3) and payments to foreign governments by resource extraction issuers.

Subtitle C--Harmonization of Derivatives Rules

(Sec. 871) The SEC and the CFTC must review specified rules relating to swap markets.

(Sec. 872) The bill exempts swap transactions between affiliates from swap rules issued by the SEC or the CFTC.

TITLE IX--REPEAL OF THE VOLCKER RULE AND OTHER PROVISIONS

(Sec. 901) The bill lifts the moratorium on the FDIC's provision of deposit insurance to industrial banks, credit-card banks, and certain trust banks.

The bill eliminates the FRB's supervisory authority over securities holding companies.

The bill repeals the "Volcker Rule," which prohibits banking agencies from engaging in proprietary trading or entering into certain relationships with hedge funds and private equity funds.

Current law prohibits an underwriter, placement agent, initial purchaser, or sponsor of an asset-backed security from engaging, within one year&#160;after the first closing of the sale of the asset-backed security, in a transaction that would involve a material conflict of interest. The bill repeals this prohibition.

TITLE X--FED OVERSIGHT REFORM AND MODERNIZATION

(Sec. 1001) The bill amends the Federal Reserve Act to require the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to, after each meeting, submit to Congress a Directive Policy Rule&#160;for open market operations that includes&#160;specified information and meets certain other requirements.

(Sec. 1002) The bill restricts the type of public communications that FOMC members and staff may make&#160;regarding financial developments or monetary policy during a "blackout period" (i.e., a period extending from approximately one week&#160;before an FOMC meeting to approximately one day afterwards).

(Sec. 1003) The FOMC must make full transcripts of its meetings available to the public.

(Sec. 1004) The bill alters the membership of the FOMC.

 (Sec. 1007) The bill: (1)&#160;subjects members and employees of the&#160;FRB to&#160;additional ethics standards as well as specified restrictions on financial interests, transactions and outside employment; (2) requires such members and employees to disclose all brokerage accounts and other accounts in which they have a financial interest; and (3) requires the&#160;FRB to publicly disclose salary information&#160;with respect to&#160;certain staff.

(Sec. 1008) The bill limits the FRB's emergency-lending authority to cases in which the financial stability of the United States is threatened. Moreover, the FRB may not exercise its emergency-lending authority without the affirmative votes of at least nine Federal Reserve bank presidents.

The FRB must issue specified rules regarding: (1)&#160;the collateral required to secure loans made under its emergency-lending authority, and (2) the minimum interest rate on loans made under its emergency-lending authority.

A borrower shall be ineligible to borrow from an emergency-lending program unless the borrower is certified by the&#160;FRB and federal banking regulators as solvent.

 (Sec. 1010) The bill removes specified limitations on GAO audits of the FRB and Federal Reserve banks.
