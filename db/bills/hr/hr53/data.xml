 This bill directs the Department of Homeland Security to establish and maintain a national database for human trafficking investigations. It requires a federal, state, or local law enforcement agency that conducts a human trafficking investigation to enter information into the database. The Department of Justice must reduce by 20% the allocation of funds under the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant program for a state or local government that fails to comply.</summary>
