    "text": "High-Skilled Integrity and Fairness Act of 2017\n\nThis bill amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to: (1) eliminate the per-country limit for employment-based immigrant visas, and (2) increase the limit for family sponsored visas.\n\nThe bill revises: (1) the H-1B nonimmigrant visa (specialty occupation) program, including by revising the definition of \"exempt H-1B nonimmigrant\"; and (2) the computation of prevailing wage level for purposes of occupational classification.\n\nThe bill provides that H-1B visas will be allocated on a three-tiered wage-based system if H-1B visa petitions exceed the number of visas available for a fiscal year.\n\nAn employer may not reduce H-1B wages, except for taxes, garnishments, or under a collective bargaining agreement or where otherwise customary.\n\nThe bill reserves 20% of fiscal year H-1B visas for employers with 50 or fewer full-time employees, including parent, subsidiary, and other affiliated entities.\n\nThe bill authorizes dual intent for F-1 visa foreign students. (Dual intent is an immigration concept that allows aliens to be temporarily present in the United States with nonimmigrant status and immigrant intent.)\n\nStudents may use work experience as qualifying labor certification experience.\n\nAn amended H-1B petition shall not be required where a petitioner has a valid labor condition application for a new place of employment that has terms and conditions of employment that are the same as the previous place of employment.\n\nThe receipt of information from an employer for H-1B hiring purposes shall not be considered to be the receipt of information for purposes of determining employer compliance with labor condition requirements."
