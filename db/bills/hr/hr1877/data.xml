  <summary date="2017-04-04T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill requires the Office of Fossil Energy to carry out a research, development, and technology demonstration program to improve the efficiency of gas turbines used in power generation systems and to identify the technologies that will lead to gas turbine combined cycle efficiency of 67% or simple cycle efficiency of 50%.

The program must: (1) support first-of-a-kind engineering and detailed gas turbine design for megawatt-scale and utility-scale electric power generation; (2) include technology demonstration through component testing, subscale testing, and full scale testing in existing fleets; (3) include field demonstrations of the developed technology elements to demonstrate technical and economic feasibility; and (4) assess overall combined cycle and simple cycle system performance.

The goals of the multiphase program must be:

 in phase I, to develop the conceptual design of, and to develop and demonstrate the technology required for, advanced high efficiency gas turbines that can achieve at least 65% combined cycle efficiency or 47% simple cycle efficiency on a lower heating value basis; and in phase II, to develop the conceptual design for advanced high efficiency gas turbines that can achieve at least 67% combined cycle efficiency or 50% simple cycle efficiency on a lower heating value basis. In selecting program proposals, the office must emphasize the extent to which the proposal will stimulate the creation or increased retention of jobs in the United States and promote and enhance U.S. technology leadership.</summary>
