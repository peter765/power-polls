This bill amends the federal criminal code to establish a process to expunge an individual's records related to a nonviolent criminal offense. A nonviolent criminal offense is a federal misdemeanor or felony offense that: (1) does not include, as an element, the use of a weapon or violence; and (2) does not involve violence in its commission.

To be eligible for expungement, an individual must: have no violent offense convictions and not more than one other nonviolent offense conviction; avoid drug or alcohol dependency or abuse; obtain a high school diploma; and fulfill the requirements of a court-ordered sentence, such as complete a prison term and meet the conditions of supervised release.</summary>
