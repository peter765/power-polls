    "text": "Aid to Allies Act\n\nThis bill expresses the sense of Congress that:\n\n in periods of constrained resources all budget items deserve scrutiny, especially foreign aid dollars; rather than assisting governments that undermine our allies, such dollars would be better spent in countries that support the shared interests of the American people; and the Board of the Millennium Challenge Corporation should not enter into any compact with Senegal until the board reports to Congress regarding Senegal's eligibility to meet specified democratic and economic criteria that consider the impact of Senegal's co-sponsorship of U.N. Security Council Resolution 2334 and other governance issues with respect to Senegal. Such resolution characterizes Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem as illegal and demands cessation of settlement activities.\n\nThe bill prohibits Senegal from receiving certain development assistance under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 for two years and makes such assistance available to Rwanda and Uganda.\n\nThe President's Malaria Initiative, the Feed the Future program, and the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief are exempted from such prohibition."
