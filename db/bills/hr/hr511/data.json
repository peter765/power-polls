The summary of that version is repeated here.)\n\nPower And Security Systems (PASS) Act\n\nThis bill amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to require the Department of Energy to issue a rule by July 1, 2021, that determines whether energy conservation standards for external power supplies should be amended. The rule must contain any amended standards and apply to products manufactured on or after July 1, 2023.\n\nCurrent law exempts external power supplies for security or life safety systems (e.g., smoke alarms) from energy conservation standards until July 1, 2017. This bill extends the exemption until July 1, 2023."
