The subsidy may be up to 50% of an individual's wages. Individuals are eligible for subsidized wages if they: (1) are recipients of TANF or similar state assistance or a noncustodial parent of a child receiving such assistance, (2) are unemployed when the subsidy begins, and (3) have an income below 200% of the poverty line.\n\nStates must ensure that participants in subsidized job programs do not displace current workers.\n\nThe ACF must reserve funding to carry out this bill from amounts in the Contingency Fund for State Welfare Programs."
