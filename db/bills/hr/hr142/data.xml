This bill amends the federal criminal code to make it a crime for a business entity or product supervisor to knowingly conceal information about a serious danger associated with a product or business practice. Specifically, it imposes criminal penalties&#8212;a fine, a prison term of up to five years, or both&#8212;on a business entity or product supervisor who knows of a serious danger and knowingly fails to warn employees and inform a federal agency.

Additionally, the bill makes it a crime to knowingly retaliate against (i.e., engage in employment discrimination against) an employee who warns other employees or informs a federal agency of a serious danger with a product or practice. It imposes criminal penalties&#8212;a fine, a prison term of up to one year, or both&#8212;on a violator.</summary>
