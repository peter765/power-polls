    "text": "Community Parks Revitalization Act\n\n This bill requires the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to carry out a community revitalization program of federal grants to eligible local governments located within standard metropolitan statistical areas for various park and recreation purposes, including grants for rehabilitation and construction, innovation and recreation programming, and recovery action programs.\n\nHUD may designate local governments not located in standard metropolitan statistical areas to receive such grants under a partial eligibility waiver.\n\nThe bill prescribes requirements, including matching requirements, for rehabilitation and construction and for innovation and recreation grants.\n\nThis bill limits to 10% the use of funds appropriated for rehabilitation and construction grants for acquisition of land or interests in land.\n\nA recipient may transfer a grant in whole or in part to private nonprofit agencies for recreational areas and facilities they own or operate which offer recreational opportunities to the general population.\n\nFor project approval, an applicant must submit to HUD evidence of its commitment to ongoing planning, rehabilitation, service, operation, and maintenance programs for its park and recreation systems, expressed in a five-year local park and recreation recovery action program.\n\nThe bill prescribes requirements for the five-year park and recreation recovery action program under an at-risk youth recreation grant.\n\nHUD may increase federal rehabilitation and construction, innovation, and at-risk youth recreation grants to a state under this bill by an additional match of up to 15% (but not more than 15%) of total project or program cost. The bill limits the aggregate amount of the grant and the additional grant amounts to 85% of total project or program cost.\n\nThe bill prohibits the conversion, without HUD approval, of any property improved or developed with assistance under this bill for uses other than for public recreation."
