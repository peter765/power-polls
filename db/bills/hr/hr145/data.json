After such redistricting, no state may use federal funds directly for election administration purposes unless it certifies to the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) that it conducts redistricting for its legislative districts using an NIRC redistricting plan.\n\nEach state must hold open primaries for elections for federal office. A state may not use any federal funds provided directly for election administration purposes unless it certifies to the EAC that it holds open primaries for elections for state and local office."
