This bill amends the Department of Education Organization Act to require the Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights to publish, on its website, the names of institutions of higher education (IHEs) that request and IHEs that receive religious exemptions from title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972. (Title IX prohibits sex discrimination in federally funded education programs and activities.)

Additionally, the bill amends title IV (Student Assistance) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 to require an IHE that requests, receives, exercises, or intends to exercise a religious exemption from title IX to publish, on its website, certain information with respect to such exemption.</summary>
