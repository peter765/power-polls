(Currently, the USPS issues semipostals using its own discretion to determine the causes it considers to be in the national public interest.)\n\nThe bill also makes entities (currently, only agencies) eligible to receive amounts that become available from the sale of semipostals. Congress must determine the appropriate agencies or entities that receive such amounts."
