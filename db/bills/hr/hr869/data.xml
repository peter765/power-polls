This bill establishes a Commission to Study the Potential Creation of a National Museum of Asian Pacific American History and Culture.

The Commission must: (1) report recommendations for a plan of action for the establishment and maintenance of a National Museum of Asian Pacific American History and Culture in Washington, D.C.; (2) develop a fundraising plan to support the establishment, operation, and maintenance of the Museum through public contributions; (3) obtain an independent review of this fundraising plan, including an analysis of the resources necessary to fund the construction of the Museum and its operations and maintenance in perpetuity without reliance on federal funds; and (4) submit a legislative plan of action to establish and construct the Museum.

 The Commission shall submit a report to Congress that addresses specified issues, including the impact of the Museum on regional Asian Pacific American history-related museums, whether it should be part of the Smithsonian Institution, and the cost of constructing, operating, and maintaining the Museum and acquiring its collections.

The Commission may convene a national conference relating to the Museum.</summary>
