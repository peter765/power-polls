The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.)\n\nUnited States-Israel Cybersecurity Cooperation Enhancement Act of 2017\u00a0\n\n(Sec. 2) This bill requires the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to establish a grant program to support cybersecurity research and development, and the demonstration and commercialization of cybersecurity technology, in accordance with the Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the State of Israel on Cooperation in Science and Technology for Homeland Security Matters, dated May 29, 2008, or a successor agreement.\n\nGrants may be awarded for social science research and technology intended to identify, protect against, respond to, and recover from cybersecurity threats.\n\nTo be eligible for a grant, a project must be a joint venture between: (1) for-profit, nonprofit, or academic entities (including U.S. national laboratories) in the United States and Israel; or (2) the governments of the United States and Israel.\n\nGrants shall be awarded only for projects considered unclassified by both the United States and Israel.\n\nDHS must require cost sharing of at least 50% from nonfederal sources for grant activities, but it may reduce the nonfederal percentage if necessary on a case-by-case basis.\n\nDHS must establish an advisory board to monitor the impartial scientific and technical merit method by which grants are awarded and provide periodic reviews of the actions taken to carry out the program.\n\nThe grant program terminates seven years after this bill's enactment."
