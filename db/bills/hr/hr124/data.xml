  <summary date="2017-01-03T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Camera Accountability Maintenance and Transparency in Policing Act of 2017 or the CAM TIP Act of 2017

This bill amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to establish a grant program for state, local, and tribal governments to acquire, operate, and maintain body-worn cameras for law enforcement officers.

Additionally, it establishes a task force in the Department of Justice (DOJ) to provide recommendations on community policing, including best practices for accountability and transparency.

DOJ must study the cost to purchase and use body-worn cameras.

Finally, the Government Accountability Office must study and report on the Department of Defense Excess Personal Property Program.</summary>
