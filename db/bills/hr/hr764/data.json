    "text": "Housing America's Workforce Act of 2017 \n\n This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow employers a business-related tax credit for up to 50% (100% for small business employers) of the qualified housing expenses paid for the benefit of their employees. The bill defines \"qualified housing expenses\" to include homeownership assistance and rental assistance. The bill limits the annual amount of such credit per employee to the lesser of $10,000 or 6% of an employee's home purchase price, or up to $5,000 for rental assistance, adjusted for inflation after 2017. The bill excludes from employee gross income the value of employer-paid housing assistance.\n\nThe Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) may award grants in FY2017-FY2019, on a competitive basis, to nonprofit housing organizations or local governments for certain costs, including operating costs and technical assistance costs, of employer-assisted housing programs. HUD must establish a national clearinghouse, including a website, to provide information about employer-assisted housing programs to federal, state, and local governments; and other interested entities.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office must conduct a study of employer-assisted housing programs and provide HUD with an interim report by January 1, 2020, and final report by December 31, 2021."
