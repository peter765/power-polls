This bill directs the Federal Communications Commission to require telecommunications carriers that provide Lifeline services to require Lifeline subscribers to re-apply for the service every 12 months&#160;in order for the carriers to receive federal reimbursement for providing&#160;such services. (Lifeline is the federal government program to provide telecommunications services to low-income individuals. Current federal regulations require telecommunications carriers to annually&#160;certify that&#160;their Lifeline subscribers are still eligible for the service.)&#160;&#160;</summary>
