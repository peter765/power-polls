  <summary date="2017-07-27T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill requires the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to report to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and Congress on the filing requirements for telecommunications carriers or service providers that receive Universal Service Fund support under the Communications Act of 1934 to provide service to qualifying low-income consumers, rural or high-cost areas, rural health care providers, schools, or libraries under the Connect America, Lifeline, E-Rate, Rural Health Care, Remote Areas, Connect America Fund Broadband Loop Support, and Mobility programs. The report must analyze the financial impact of those filing requirements and provide any recommendations on how to consolidate redundant filing requirements.

After receiving the GAO's report, the FCC must initiate a rulemaking to consolidate redundant filing requirements and incorporate any GAO recommendations that would not violate the Administrative Procedure Act into such rulemaking or any ongoing rulemakings.</summary>
