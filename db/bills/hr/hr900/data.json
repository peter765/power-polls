Such treaty shall establish the details of the bilateral relations of Puerto Rico and the United States under specified guidelines with respect to citizenship, vested rights, trade, public debt and economic transition, currency, and defense.\n\nThe President shall negotiate the terms for a Compact of Free Association with the government of Puerto Rico, which shall be submitted to Congress and the people of Puerto Rico for ratification under specified agreed guidelines with respect to Puerto Rican sovereignty and self-government, the termination of the free association relationship when Puerto Rico becomes fully independent, the continuation of U.S. citizenship for citizens of Puerto Rico, and the continuation of trade relations with the United States."
