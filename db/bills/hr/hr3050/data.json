In developing a state energy security plan, a state must coordinate with:(1)the public utility or service commission of the state,(2)energy providers from the private sector, and(3)other entities responsible for maintaining fuel or electric reliability.\n\nUpon request of a state, the Department of Energy (DOE) may provide information and technical assistance, and other assistance, in the development, implementation, or revision of a state energy security plan.\n\nDOE's authority to carry out this bill's provisions expires on October 31, 2022."
