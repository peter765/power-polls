This bill directs the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to develop regulations that would establish a national standard for determining whether mobile service, mobile data service,&#160;and broadband service in rural areas are reasonably comparable to the services provided in urban areas.

The FCC shall gather data about&#160;the average signal strengths and speeds of mobile services and the average speeds of broadband internet services from the 20 most-populated urban areas. The services provided in rural areas shall be deemed reasonably comparable to urban area if the signal strengths and/or speeds meet or exceed the averages in the most-populated areas.</summary>
