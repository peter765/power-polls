This bill amends the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 to require the National Security Council, in consultation with the Department of Justice and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, to ensure a mitigation process and protocols are in place if the President publicly discloses classified intelligence without notifying the congressional intelligence committees.

If the President authorizes the public disclosure of classified information, the President is responsible for notifying the congressional intelligence committees of that disclosure.</summary>
