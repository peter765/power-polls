This bill amends the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act to include assistance to dislocated workers through increased outreach about small business opportunities and consultation about starting a small business among the rapid response activities to assist such workers in obtaining reemployment which a state or a state-designated entity provides in the event of a permanent closure or mass layoff at a plant, facility, or enterprise or a natural or other disaster resulting in mass job dislocation.

A state may in such an event allocate up to 10% of funds reserved by the state governor for statewide rapid response activities to provide outreach about small business opportunities and consultation about starting a small business.

This bill amends the definition of "rapid response activities" under such Act to include among state activities to assist dislocated workers the provision of information on and access to training and activities related to entrepreneurship.</summary>
