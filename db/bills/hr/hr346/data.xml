This bill amends the federal criminal code to increase to five years the post-employment lobbying ban on a former member of the U.S. Senate (currently, two years) or a former member of the U.S. House of Representatives (currently, one year).

Additionally, the bill amends the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 to revise the definition of "lobbyist." Currently, a lobbyist is an individual who: (1) is employed or retained by a client for compensation, (2) makes more than one lobbying contact, and (3) spends at least 20% of the time working for that client on lobbying activities. This bill broadens the term lobbyist to include an individual who spends less than 20% of the time working for a client on lobbying activities, if that individual is a former Member of Congress.</summary>
