This bill prohibits the McCarran-Ferguson Act from being construed to permit health insurance or medical malpractice insurance issuers to engage in price fixing, bid rigging, or market allocations in connection with providing health insurance or medical malpractice coverage.

This bill amends the McCarran-Ferguson Act to provide that nothing in that Act modifies, impairs, or supersedes the operation of antitrust laws with respect to the business of health insurance. Prohibitions of unfair methods of competition apply to the business of health insurance without regard to whether the business is for profit.</summary>
