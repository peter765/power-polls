    "text": "Bring Small Businesses Back Tax Reform Act \n\nThis bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to establish new maximum individual tax rates for qualified business income that does not exceed $1 million (i.e., small business income). The maximum rates are: (1) 12% of such income not exceeding $150,000, and (2) 25% for income that exceeds $150,000 and is not more than $1 million.\n\nThe rates apply to up to $1 million of qualified business income that is: (1) gross earnings derived by an individual from any active trade or business carried on by the individual, excluding deductions attributable to the trade or business; or (2) the taxpayer's distributive or pro rata share of pass-through income from entities such as a partnership or S corporation. Qualified business income does not include capital gains, interest, dividends, or royalties.\n\nFor taxpayers that are not a corporation or a partnership with a corporation as a partner, the bill repeals the annual limitation on the election to expense certain depreciable business assets.\n\nThe bill also permits certain small businesses whose average gross receipts do not exceed $25 million (currently, $5 million) to use the cash accounting method without limitations and exempts such businesses from inventory rules."
