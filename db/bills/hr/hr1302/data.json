The expanded summary of the House reported version is repeated here.)\n\nTerrorist and Foreign Fighter Travel Exercise Act of 2017\n\n(Sec. 2) This bill requires the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to develop and conduct an exercise related to the terrorist and foreign fighter threat in order to enhance domestic preparedness for and the collective response to terrorism, promote the dissemination of homeland security information, and test the U.S. security posture.\n\nSuch exercise shall include: (1) a scenario involving persons traveling from the United States to join or provide material support or resources to a terrorist organization abroad and terrorist infiltration into the United States, including by U.S. citizens and foreign nationals; and (2) coordination with relevant federal agencies, foreign governments, and state, local, tribal, territorial, and private sector stakeholders.\n\nDHS shall submit an after-action report, including any identified or potential vulnerabilities in U.S. defenses and requested legislative changes.\n\n(Sec. 3) The bill amends the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006 to require the national exercise program (a program to test and evaluate the national preparedness goal, National Incident Management System, National Response Plan, and other related plans and strategies) to be designed to include exercises addressing emerging terrorist threats, such as such a scenario."
