An adjacent landholder may only acquire one eligible parcel a year, subject to an exception.\n\n The BLM or the Forest Service, as consideration for the sale of an eligible parcel, shall require a cash payment that is equal to at least the fair market value of such parcel, including the mineral estate, being conveyed.\n\n The purchaser of an eligible federal lands parcel under this bill shall cover the costs to be incurred, or to reimburse the BLM or the Forest Service for the costs incurred, in carrying out the conveyance.\n\n A conveyance of an eligible federal lands parcel under this bill is categorically excluded from the requirement to prepare an environmental assessment or an environmental impact statement under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969."
