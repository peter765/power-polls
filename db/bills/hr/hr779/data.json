Such a designation shall be terminated when the President certifies to Congress that either or both of these circumstances no longer apply.\n\nThe bill deems Syria to be a country of conflict concern.\n\nThe Presidentshall require a U.S. national to obtain a license to: (1) travel to a country of conflict concern, or (2) provide material support to entities engaged in armed conflict in such a country. Specified penalties shall apply to a person who violates such requirements."
