The Bureau shall give priority to projects that serve an area: (1) that has received federal authorization for projects associated with perchlorate contamination remediation programs under the Bureau or the Corps of Engineers, (2) for which a feasibility study for perchlorate remediation efforts that is acceptable to the Bureau or the Corps of Engineers has been completed, or (3) where the regional water agency that imports out-of-basin water supplies has a wholesale area that includes a population of not more than 350,000.\n\nThe federal share shall not exceed 25% of the total cost of such a project."
