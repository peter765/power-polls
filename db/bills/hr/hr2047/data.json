For a period of five years,\u00a0a state's\u00a0FMAP for such improvements shall equal 90%. (Generally, a state's FMAP under Medicaid\u00a0may range\u00a0from 50% to 83%.)\n\nThe bill also establishes a grant program for states to establish or support a behavioral health assistance office or ombudsman\u00a0to\u00a0coordinate behavioral health and other assistance for\u00a0Medicaid beneficiaries. The office or ombudsman shall: (1) track, quantify, and report on\u00a0problems and inquiries encountered by Medicaid beneficiaries with respect to access to\u00a0behavioral health services; (2) educate Medicaid beneficiaries on their rights and responsibilities to such access; and\u00a0(3) assist Medicaid beneficiaries in\u00a0the enforcement of\u00a0those rights and in accessing services."
