The bill sets forth certain employer duties with respect to such requests.\n\nThe bill prohibits an employer from interfering with any rights provided to an employee under this bill. An employee may file a complaint with the Department of Labor for any violations of such rights. Labor shall investigate and attempt to resolve such complaints and may issue orders making determinations and assessing civil penalties or awarding relief for alleged violations. The bill provides for judicial review of such orders, including in federal courts of appeal.\n\n Labor and certain federal agencies and offices shall provide information and technical assistance to employers, labor organizations, and the general public regarding compliance with this bill.\n\n The Wage and Hour Division of Labor must issue guidance on compliance with the Fair Labor Standards Act that provides for a flexible work environment through changes in employee terms and conditions of employment as provided in this bill.\n\nThe requirements of this bill are applicable to certain classes of employees, including employees of the Government Accountability Office and the Library of Congress."
