A credit or refund of the tax must be issued for products that are withdrawn from the market, lost, or destroyed.\n\nThe bill requires producers, importers, and exporters of marijuana products to:\n\n obtain a permit and a bond covering tax liability from the Department of the Treasury prior to beginning operations, meet recordkeeping requirements, and comply with certain policies and restrictions regarding packaging and labeling. The bill also: (1) establishes penalties for violations of marijuana laws, and (2) prohibits the sale of more than one ounce of marijuana in any single retail transaction."
