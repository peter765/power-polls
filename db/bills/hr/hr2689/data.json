    "text": "Requirements, Expectations, and Standard Procedures for Executive Consultation with Tribes Act or the RESPECT Act\n\nThis bill requires federal agencies to have a process to ensure meaningful and timely input by Native American tribes before undertaking an activity that may have substantial direct impacts on the lands or interests of the tribes, on the relationship between the federal government and the tribes, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities between the government and the tribes. Agencies may temporarily waive these requirements in an emergency.\n\nFederal agencies must: (1) recognize and respect tribal self-government and sovereignty, honor tribal rights, and strive to meet the responsibilities that arise from the unique legal relationship between the federal government and tribal governments; (2) grant tribal governments maximum discretion in the administration of federal statutes and regulations; (3) streamline the processes under which tribes apply for waivers of statutory and regulatory requirements; and (4) consider waiver applications with a view toward increasing opportunities for flexible policy approaches.\n\nTribes may seek judicial review of a determination of an agency under this bill if the tribe has exhausted all other administrative remedies."
