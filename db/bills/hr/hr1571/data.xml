This bill amends the Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1974 to direct the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), in making grants to fire departments, nonaffiliated emergency medical services organizations, and state fire training academies, to give high priority consideration to grants that provide for planning, training, and equipment to firefighters for crude oil-by-rail and ethanol-by-rail derailment and incident response.</summary>
