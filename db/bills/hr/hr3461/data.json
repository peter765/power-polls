Specifically, demonstration projects shall focus on: (1) using the abilities of direct-care workers to promote smooth transitions in care and help prevent unnecessary hospital readmissions, (2) maintaining and improving the health status of those with multiple chronic conditions and long-term needs, and (3) training direct-care workers to take on deeper clinical responsibilities."
