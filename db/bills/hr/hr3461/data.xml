  <summary date="2017-07-27T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Improving Care for Vulnerable Older Citizens through Workforce Advancement Act of 2017 

This bill amends the Older Americans Act of 1965 to direct the Administration on Aging to award grants for eligible&#160;consortia of health care providers and facilities to carry out six separate demonstration projects that focus on care coordination and service delivery for older individuals who have&#160;chronic illness or are at risk of institutional placement. Specifically, demonstration projects shall focus on: (1) using the abilities of direct-care workers to promote smooth transitions in care and help prevent unnecessary hospital readmissions, (2) maintaining and improving the health status of those with multiple chronic conditions and long-term needs, and (3) training direct-care workers to take on deeper clinical responsibilities.</summary>
