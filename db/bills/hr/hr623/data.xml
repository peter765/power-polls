This bill directs the Federal Trade Commission to require prescribers of animal drugs to verify prescriptions and provide copies of prescriptions to pet owners, pet owner designees, and pharmacies, without the prescriber demanding payment or establishing other conditions. The bill applies these requirements to medication for a domesticated household animal that consumers are not allowed to purchase without a prescription.

A violation of this bill shall be treated as an unfair or deceptive act or practice under the Federal Trade Commission Act.</summary>
