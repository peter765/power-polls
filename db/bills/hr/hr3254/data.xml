  <summary date="2017-07-14T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Heroin and Opioid Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act of 2017

This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to require manufacturers, producers, and importers of active opioids to pay an excise tax of one cent per milligram of opioid.

The bill also amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to provide grants to states for: (1) research on opioids (including heroin), and (2) opioid abuse prevention and treatment.

The Department of the Treasury must transfer an amount equal to the revenue collected from the tax to HHS to carry out this bill. The bill makes the funds available without further appropriation and designates the funding as an emergency requirement under the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 (PAYGO).</summary>
