    "text": "Commodity End User Relief Act\n\nThis bill reauthorizes through FY2021, and revises provisions related to, operations of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).\n\nIn addition, the bill amends the Commodity Exchange Act to direct registered futures associations to require their futures commission merchant members to meet certain procedural and reporting requirements.\n\n The CFTC is authorized to require that certain property of the bankruptcy estate of a commodity broker who is a debtor in Chapter 7 bankruptcy (also known as \"liquidation\" bankruptcy) be included in customer property to the extent that such property is insufficient to satisfy the net equity claims of the broker's public customers.\n\n Before promulgating a regulation or issuing an order, the CFTC must publish an assessment of the costs and benefits of the action.\n\nThe heads of the CFTC's administrative units shall serve at the pleasure of the CFTC.\n\nThe bill establishes, within the CFTC, the Office of the Chief Economist.\n\nThe duration of an omnibus order of investigation (authorizing the CFTC to issue subpoenas to multiple persons in relation to a particular subject matter area) shall not be indefinite.\n\nThe bill exempts specified entities from certain\u00a0clearing requirements applicable to swaps.\n\n With respect to swap dealer registration requirements, the bill: (1)\u00a0prohibits the CFTC from modifying,\u00a0except by affirmative rule or regulation,\u00a0the threshold for de minimus (minor in quantity) swap dealing; (2) under certain circumstances, allows the use of specified financial models with respect to calculating capital requirements; and (3) modifies other provisions.\n\nThe bill exempts certain swap activities involving non-U.S. persons\u00a0from U.S. swaps requirements."
