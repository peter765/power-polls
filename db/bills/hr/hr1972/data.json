In requiring a veteran to make a copayment for care or services provided at a VA or a non-VA medical facility, the VA shall notify the veteran not later than 120 days (18 months in the case of a non-VA facility) after the date on which the veteran received the care or services. If the VA does not provide notification by such date, it may not collect the payment, including through a third-party entity, unless the veteran is provided with:\n\n information about applying for a waiver and establishing a payment plan with the VA, and an opportunity to make a waiver or establish a payment plan. The VA shall review and improve its copayment billing internal controls and notification procedures."
