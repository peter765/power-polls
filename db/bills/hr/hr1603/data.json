In addition, ED is authorized to award grants to rural-serving institutions of higher education for: (1) increasing enrollment and graduation rates of students from rural areas in postbaccalaureate physician assistant education programs, and (2) training physician assistants in rural areas through the creation and expansion of physician assistant education programs in rural areas.\n\nED may also award grants to physician assistant education programs for enhancing the programs and improving patient safety by supporting the purchase of new infrastructure and technology."
