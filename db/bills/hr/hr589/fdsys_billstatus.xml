          <text><![CDATA[<p><b>Department of Energy Research and Innovation Act</b> </p> <p>TITLE I--LABORATORY MODERNIZATION AND TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER</p> <p><i>Laboratory Modernization and Technology Transfer Act</i></p> <p>(Sec. 102) This bill instructs the Department of Energy (DOE) to permit specified National Laboratories owned by DOE to use funds authorized to support technology transfer within DOE to: (1) carry out early stage and precommercial technology demonstration activities to remove technology barriers limiting private sector interest, and (2) demonstrate potential commercial applications of any research and technologies arising from activities of the national laboratories. </p> <p>(Sec. 103) The bill expresses the sense of Congress that Congress, DOE, and energy industry participants should advance efforts to promote international, domestic, and regional cooperation on the research and development of energy innovations that:</p> <ul> <li>provide clean, affordable, and reliable energy;</li> <li>promote economic growth;</li> <li>are critical for energy security; and </li> <li>are sustainable without government support. </li> </ul> <p>(Sec. 104) DOE shall ensure that laboratory operating contractors do not allocate costs of general and administrative overhead to laboratory-directed research and development. This prohibition does not apply to certain national security laboratories.</p> <p>(Sec. 105) DOE shall establish and maintain a public database, accessible on its website, containing a searchable listing of the contracts, grant, cooperative agreements, task orders for federally funded research centers, or other DOE-administered transactions for unclassified research and development projects. </p> <p>DOE shall provide information through such database on relevant literature and patents that are associated with each such project contract, grant, or cooperative agreement, or other transaction, of DOE.</p> <p>(Sec. 106) Within one year of enactment of this bill and as often as determined to be necessary thereafter, DOE shall report on its ability to successfully transfer new energy technologies to the private sector. </p> <p>(Sec. 107) DOE shall carry out the Agreements for Commercializing Technology pilot program in accordance with this bill, including by giving the contractors of the national laboratories increased authority to negotiate contract terms and making every such facility eligible for the program. The pilot program is extended through FY2019.</p> <p> DOE shall permit the directors of the national laboratories to execute agreements with non-federal entities. </p> <p> The bill: (1) subjects funding agreements to the requirements of the Bayh-Dole Act (concerning patent rights to inventions arising from federally-supported research and development), and (2) imposes contractor certification requirements for the avoidance of direct competition with the private sector and conflicts of interest. </p> <p>(Sec. 108) The bill amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to exempt institutions of higher education and nonprofit institutions from the cost-sharing requirements for research and development for two years. </p> <p>During such period, DOE shall submit an initial report, then subsequent annual reports, that describe the use of cost-sharing waivers by DOE with regard to carrying out research, development, demonstration, and commercial application programs and activities that have been initiated since August 9, 2005. </p> <p>TITLE II--DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY RESEARCH COORDINATION</p> <p><i>Department of Energy Research Coordination Act</i></p> <p>(Sec. 202) The bill amends the America Competes Act to require the following types of information collected by the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) from recipients of financial assistance awards to be considered commercial and financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential and therefore not subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act: </p> <ul> <li>plans for commercialization of technologies developed under the award,</li> <li>investments provided to an awardee from third parties,</li> <li>additional financial support that the awardee plans to or has invested into the technology developed under the award or is seeking from third parties, and </li> <li>revenue from the licensing or sale of new products or services that result from the research conducted under the award. </li> </ul> <p>(Sec. 203) DOE shall use its capabilities to identify strategic opportunities for collaborative research, development, demonstration, and commercial application of innovative science and technologies. </p> <p>DOE shall seek to leverage existing DOE programs and consolidate and coordinate activities throughout DOE to promote collaboration and crosscutting approaches within its programs. </p> <p>Also, DOE shall:</p> <ul> <li>prioritize activities that use all affordable domestic resources;</li> <li>develop a planning, evaluation, and technical assessment framework for setting long-term objective strategic goals and evaluating progress that ensures integrity and independence and provides the flexibility to adapt to market dynamics;</li> <li>ensure that activities do not duplicate other activities within DOE or other federal government activities; and </li> <li>identify programs that may be more effectively left to the states, industry, nongovernmental organizations, institutions of higher education, or other stakeholders. </li> </ul> <p>(Sec. 204) The bill amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to require DOE, when periodically reviewing all of its science and technology activities in a strategic framework, to also take global energy dynamics into account under such a review. </p> <p>Plans developed by DOE to improve coordination and collaboration in research, development, demonstration, and commercial application activities across DOE's organizational boundaries shall also include:</p> <ul> <li>critical assessments of any ongoing programs that have experienced subpar performance or cost overruns of 10% or more over 1 or more years;</li> <li>any activities that may be more effectively left to the states, industry, nongovernmental organizations, institutions of higher education, or other stakeholders;
