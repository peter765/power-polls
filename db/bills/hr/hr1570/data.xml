  <summary date="2017-03-16T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">African Descent Affairs Act of 2017

This bill amends the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 to direct the Department of State to establish within an Office of Global African Descent Affairs, to be headed by the Director and Special Advisor to the Secretary on Global African Descent Affairs.

Office functions shall include:

 advising the Secretary of State and directing policies, programs, and funding relating to the human rights and the advancement of people of African descent internationally; developing and managing the Fund for African Descent Affairs to invest in solutions to combat racial discrimination and create economic and other opportunities for people of African descent internationally; directing U.S. government resources to respond to needs for protection, integration, resettlement, and empowerment of people of African descent in U.S. policies and international programs; and compiling an annual report on U.S. government activities relating to people of African descent. The bill amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to include in the annual human rights report for countries in the Americas, Europe, Asia, and the Middle East a description of the status and the people of African descent in each country.

The U.S. Agency for International Development (AID) shall appoint a Senior Advisor to the Administrator on Global African Descent Affairs who shall: (1) advise the AID Administrator and direct policies, programs, and funding relating to the human rights and advancement of people of African descent internationally; and (2) develop a uniform set of indicators and standards for monitoring and evaluating foreign assistance for people of African descent.

The Director and Special Advisor to the Secretary on Global African Descent Affairs shall develop or update annually (for 10 years after the initial report) a U.S. global strategy to empower, prevent, and respond to discrimination and violence against people of African descent.</summary>
