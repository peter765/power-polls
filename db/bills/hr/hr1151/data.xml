This bill amend title XI (General Provisions) of the Social Security Act to require the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS), in approving Medicaid demonstration projects, to:

 post on its website information regarding how CMS prioritizes projects that have been proven effective in improving care and outcomes with respect to uninsured, Medicaid-eligible, or low-income individuals; collect, from a&#160;participating state, available data regarding the quality of care or health outcomes with respect to individuals served; post on its website information regarding how a&#160;project is not duplicative of any federal program or funding opportunity; and collect, from a&#160;participating state, an analysis of the degree to which such projects displace private and charitable sector efforts to improve&#160;care and outcomes&#160;with respect to uninsured, Medicaid-eligible, or&#160;low-income individuals.&#160;</summary>
