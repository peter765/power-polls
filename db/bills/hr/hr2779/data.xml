This bill amends title XI (General Provisions) of the Social Security Act to establish a Medicaid payment model demonstration project for recruiting and retaining physicians to serve low-income individuals residing in counties in which at least 35% of residents are enrolled in Medicaid. In evaluating such a test model, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation must assess: (1) the model's&#160;applicability to informing national strategies; and (2) the degree to which Medicaid payment strategies reduce emergency-department utilization and improve access, outcomes, and patient satisfaction.</summary>
