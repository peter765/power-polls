In evaluating such a test model, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation must assess: (1) the model's\u00a0applicability to informing national strategies; and (2) the degree to which Medicaid payment strategies reduce emergency-department utilization and improve access, outcomes, and patient satisfaction."
