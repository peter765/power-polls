    "text": "Head Start Improvement Act of 2017\n\nThis bill amends the Head Start Act to replace the existing Head Start program with block grants to states and Indian tribes for prekindergarten (pre-K) education.\n\nInstead of providing direct financial assistance to Head Start agencies, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) shall allot block grant funds for pre-K education among eligible states and Indian tribes in accordance with\u00a0their relative proportions of children, age five and younger, from low-income households.\u00a0Grant recipients\u00a0shall use the grant funds to: (1)\u00a0award subgrants to eligible entities\u00a0that provide\u00a0pre-K education programs; (2) administer such programs; and (3) provide technical assistance, oversight, monitoring, research, and training.\n\nUnder current law, HHS is authorized to designate, monitor, and establish standards for\u00a0Head Start agencies. The bill instead shifts\u00a0pre-K program oversight and control\u00a0to states and Indian tribes, which\u00a0shall have full flexibility to use grant funds to finance the pre-K programs of\u00a0their choice.\u00a0In addition,\u00a0grant recipients may use grant funds to establish portable voucher systems that allow costs to be paid\u00a0for attendance at\u00a0private pre-K education programs.\n\nUnder current law, federal financial assistance for a Head Start program\u00a0is generally limited to\u00a080% of total program costs. The bill maintains this\u00a0limitation by\u00a0requiring grant recipients to provide matching funds equal to 20% of the grant amount."
