  <summary date="2017-06-15T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Promoting Interagency Coordination for Review of Natural Gas Pipelines Act

This bill expands the authority of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)to act as the lead agency for the purpose of coordinating all applicable federal authorizations and environmental reviews under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) with respect to authorizing a natural gas pipeline project under the Natural Gas Act.

Federal, state, and local agencies involved in the environmental review process must defer to FERC's approved scope for a NEPA review.

FERC must invite and designate the other participating agencies involved in the authorization process. A federal, state, or local agency may not participate if it informs FERC that it does not have the necessary authority or expertise, or does not intend to submit comments.

An agency that is not designated may not conduct an environmental review unless it is legally required to do so and the agency requires information that FERC could not obtain through its NEPA review.

The bill establishes a 90 day deadline to complete an authorization application for other authorizing agencies and requires concurrent reviews when multiple agencies are involved in the authorization process.

If a federal or state agency considering an aspect of an application for authorization requires the person applying for such authorization to submit data, the agency must consider any such data gathered by aerial or other remote means that the person submits.

FERC must track and publicly display on its website specific information related to the actions required to complete an authorization.</summary>
