(Sec. 2) This bill amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to authorize in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) a unified, anti-human trafficking campaign to be known as the Blue Campaign, under which the Secretary of DHS shall issue DHS-wide guidance to, and develop and coordinate training for, appropriate DHS personnel regarding:

 programs to help identify instances of human trafficking and potential connections to terrorist activities, including along the U.S. borders; systematic and routine information sharing among DHS components and the National Network of Fusion Centers regarding individuals suspected or convicted of human trafficking, patterns and practices of human trafficking, and potential connections to terrorist activities; techniques to identify suspected victims of trafficking along the U.S. borders; techniques specifically for Transportation Security Administration personnel to identify suspected trafficking victims at airport security and to serve as a liaison and resource to aviation workers and the traveling public; utilizing resources to educate partners and stakeholders and increase public awareness of human trafficking; and leveraging partnerships with governmental, non-governmental, and private sector organizations at the state and local levels to raise public awareness of human trafficking and potential connections to terrorist activities. DHS shall: (1) ensure that information technology systems utilized within DHS to record and track information regarding individuals suspected or convicted of human trafficking are capable of systematic and routine information sharing, and (2) report to Congress on the status and effectiveness of the campaign.</summary>
