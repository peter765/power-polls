Such leave may: (1) be taken intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule; and (2) consist of paid or unpaid leave, as the employer considers appropriate.\n\nThe bill: (1) allows an employer to require certification of entitlement to such leave within a leave request, (2) provides employment and benefits protection for employees upon their return from such leave, and (3) prohibits an employer from interfering with or otherwise denying the exercise of such leave rights."
