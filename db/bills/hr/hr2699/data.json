DOD shall: (1) develop a methodology to assess the rate of suicide and suicide attempts of members of the Armed Forces of units that have been deployed in support of a contingency operation after September 11, 2001, and (2) provide outreach regarding the available mental health resources for veterans enrolled in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system who were deployed with such units.\n\nInformation obtained pursuant to this bill may be used by DOD and VA officers, employees, and contractors only for the purposes of carrying it out."
