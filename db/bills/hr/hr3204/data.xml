 This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow&#160;employers who employ an average of not more than 500 full-time employees during the taxable year an on-the-job training tax credit equal to the lesser of: 50% of the job training program&#160;expenditures for a full-time&#160;employee participating in a qualified training program, or $5,000.

A "qualified training program" is a written plan of study and training that is either: (1) an apprenticeship program registered and certified with the Department of Labor under the National Apprenticeship Act; (2) a program licensed, registered, or certified by the workforce investment board or apprenticeship agency or council of a state or administered in compliance with state apprenticeship laws; (3) a program conducted by a vocational or technical education school, community college, industrial or trade training organization, or labor organization; (4) a program that conforms to apprentice training programs developed or administered by an employer trade group or committee; or (5) an industry-sponsored or -administered program that is clearly identified and commonly recognized.

The bill terminates such credit after 2019.</summary>
