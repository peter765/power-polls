This bill requires each federal agency with extramural research expenditures of over $100 million to develop a federal research public access policy that is consistent with, and that advances, the purposes of the agency and that follows common procedures for the collection and depositing of research papers.

Each federal research public access policy is applicable to: (1) researchers employed by the federal agency whose works remain in the public domain, and (2) researchers funded by the agency. The bill specifies exclusions.

Each federal agency must submit an annual report on its federal research public access policy to specified congressional committees.</summary>
