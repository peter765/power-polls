This bill permits Purple Heart veterans and their dependents to use commissary stores and MWR retail facilities on the same basis as members of the Armed Forces entitled to retired or retainer pay and their dependents.

A "Purple Heart veteran" is a veteran who has a disability that is: (1) attributable to an injury for which the veteran was awarded the Purple Heart, and (2) compensable under the laws administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs.

An "MWR retail facility" means an exchange store or other revenue-generating facility operated by nonappropriated fund activities of the Department of Defense for the morale, welfare, and recreation of members of the Armed Forces.</summary>
