  <summary date="2017-01-24T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Patient Fairness and Relief Act of 2017

This bill permits a health insurer that had in effect certain health insurance coverage in the individual market from January 1, 2013, through January 1, 2017, to continue to offer the coverage in the individual market outside of health insurance exchanges. This applies to coverage under the transitional policy of the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. (Coverage under that policy does not need to comply with certain Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act requirements, including guaranteed renewability and coverage for preexisting conditions.)

 This coverage is treated as a grandfathered health plan and thus fulfills an individual's requirement to maintain minimum essential coverage.</summary>
