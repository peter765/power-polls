Federal Agency Mail Management Act of 2017

(Sec. 2) This bill amends the Presidential and Federal Records Act Amendments of 2014 to require the General Services Administration (GSA) to provide guidance and assistance to federal agencies for effective mail processing.

The GSA: (1) must promote economy and efficiency in the selection and utilization of space, staff, equipment, and supplies for federal mail processing facilities; and (2) may inspect the mail processing practices and programs of federal agencies for purposes of recommending improvements.

The bill also provides authority for the GSA to set goals for the establishment and maintenance of federal records management systems or techniques.</summary>
