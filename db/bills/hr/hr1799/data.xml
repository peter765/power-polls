This bill declares that:

 if a member of the Armed Forces who is required to receive a physical examination as part of his or her separation from active duty has or is believed to have a medical condition that will or may make the member eligible for Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) disability compensation and benefits, the physical examination shall be performed by a VA-certified health care provider; and if such a condition is discovered during the physical examination and the examining health care provider is not VA-certified, the examination shall be completed by a VA-certified health care provider. An eligibility determination made as part of such physical examination shall be binding on the VA and be used as the basis for assigning the member's disability rating.

The VA and the Department of Defense shall jointly establish a system to share data and maintain the medical and personnel records of members of the Armed Forces and veterans.</summary>
