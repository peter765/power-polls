A \"start-up company\" is defined as any corporation or partnership that: (1) first has both gross receipts and qualified research expenses in a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2016; or (2) has both gross receipts and qualified research expenses in fewer than three taxable years beginning after December 31, 2016, and before January 1, 2022."
