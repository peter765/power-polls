 This bill amends the Clean Air Act to prohibit a regulation concerning emissions of carbon dioxide from a fossil fuel-fired electric generating unit from taking effect until the Environmental Protection Agency certifies that a sufficient number of countries have adopted climate change regulations for carbon dioxide that are at least as stringent.

A "sufficient number" is a number of countries that account for at least 80% of global carbon dioxide emissions in the last year, excluding those in the United States.</summary>
