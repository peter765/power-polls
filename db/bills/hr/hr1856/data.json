(Current law bars all tort claims against the United States that are not presented within two years after the claim accrues.)\n\nThe extension applies retroactively to any such claim that: (1) accrued on or after May 1, 1981; and (2) in the case of a claim accrued before the date of enactment of this bill, is presented within one year after such date.\n\nThe government is prohibited from asserting a defense or a bar, based on the doctrine of res judicata or collateral estoppel, to a claim that accrued before enactment of this bill and to which this bill applies."
