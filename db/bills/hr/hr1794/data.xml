  <summary date="2017-03-29T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Hold Congress Accountable Act

 This bill requires a reduction in the annual rate of pay of a Member of Congress during a government shutdown equal to the product of one day's worth of pay under such annual rate and the number of 24-hour periods during which the government shutdown is in effect. Such reduction applies to days occurring after the date of the general election for federal office held in November 2018.

For the 115th Congress, such amount of the pay of a Member of Congress shall be withheld due to a government shutdown, held in escrow until the last day of the 115th Congress, and released for payment to Members at that time.</summary>
