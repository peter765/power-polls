FEMA Accountability, Modernization and Transparency Act of 2017

(Sec. 2) This bill directs the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to ensure that the ongoing modernization of the grant systems for the administration of assistance under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act includes:

 an online interface for applicants to complete application forms, submit materials, and access the status of applications; mechanisms to eliminate duplication of benefits; and a means of sharing information among agencies and with state, local, and tribal governments to eliminate the need to file multiple applications and speed disaster recovery. FEMA shall deliver the system capabilities in increments or iterations as working components for applicant use.</summary>
