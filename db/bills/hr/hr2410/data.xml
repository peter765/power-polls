This bill amends the Public Health Service Act to authorize the Department of Health and Human Services to make grants to states to: (1) collect data on the prevalence and distribution of sickle cell disease, (2) conduct sickle cell disease public health initiatives to improve access to care and health outcomes, and (3) identify and evaluate strategies for prevention and treatment of sickle cell disease complications.

The demonstration program to improve the prevention and treatment of sickle cell disease is revised, reauthorized through FY2022, and moved from the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 to the Public Health Service Act.</summary>
