The VA may not waive any applicable provision of such laws or regulations.\n\nIf unable to make such certification, the facility shall provide the VA with an explanation of noncompliance and a description of compliance actions being taken. If a facility does not make a certification for any year, each covered official may not receive specified awards or bonuses during the subsequent year. A covered official is the: (1) director, (2) chief of staff, (3) associate director, (4) associate director for patient care, and (5) deputy chief of staff.\n\n (Sec. 3) The VA shall ensure that its directives and policies apply to, and are implemented by, each VA office or facility in a standardized manner, including at the local level."
