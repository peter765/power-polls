This bill also prescribes terms and conditions governing Coastal Plain lease sales, including the establishment of environmental protection standards and the prohibition of exporting oil produced under the lease.\n\nThe bill establishes the ANWR Alternative Energy Trust Fund, into which shall be deposited 50% of the amount of revenues from federal oil and gas leasing and operations authorized under this bill.The fund must be used to provide grants and incentives for certain energy programs, including grants for clean coal power and renewable energy initiatives, and incentives for hydroelectric production."
