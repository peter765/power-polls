This bill urges the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to ensure that preventing veteran suicide and providing veterans access to mental health care is its top reform priority.

The VA shall, every 30 days, determine and provide to the Department of Defense, with respect to the previous year:

 the average national wait times (in days) for veterans enrolled in the VA health care system to receive appointments for mental health care and primary health care at VA medical facilities, the average time for the VA to process a claim for disability compensation, and the average time for the VA to decide an appeal of such a claim. The VA shall place a sign displaying the most current such times in a conspicuous location at each career counselor or career assistance advisor office.</summary>
