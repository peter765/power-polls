Mount Hood Cooper Spur Land Exchange Clarification Act

 (Sec. 2) This bill amends the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009 to revise details of the Cooper Spur-Government Camp land exchange between the United States and Oregon.

After the final appraised value of the federal and nonfederal lands is determined and approved by Department of Agriculture (USDA), USDA shall not be required to reappraise or update that value for up to three years, unless the condition of any of the lands is significantly and substantially altered by fire, windstorm, or other events.

The bill revises conveyance conditions regarding reservation of a conservation easement to protect identified wetland, reservation of a nonexclusive trail easement, and equalization of values of the exchange properties.</summary>
