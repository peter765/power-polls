This bill amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to include workforce development as a type of clinical practice improvement activity for purposes of the Merit-based Incentive Payment System (MIPS). (MIPS adjusts Medicare payments to providers based on performance measures related to quality, cost, utilization of electronic health records, and clinical practice improvement activities.)

The bill amends the Public Health Service Act to revise and extend through FY2022 support provided by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for the development, operation, expansion, and improvement of primary care training programs.

HHS must award grants to nonprofit organizations to increase research on physician assistant education.</summary>
