Opt-out approval must be provided for the use of non-sensitive user information under a method in which users are deemed to have consented if they fail to object after being provided notice of privacy policies.\n\nThe bill allows a service provider to use information without approval for specified purposes, including for services necessary for provision of the service and to initiate, render, bill, and collect for the service.\n\nService providers must allow users to grant, deny, or withdraw approval at any time.\n\nThe bill prohibits providers from conditioning service on a user's agreement to waive privacy rights."
