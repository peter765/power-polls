With respect to a minor's blocked report, a consumer reporting agency: (1) must block the input of any information, except with permission from the minor's legal guardian or custodian; and (2) may not provide any person with a consumer report of the minor.\n\nA consumer reporting agency shall: (1) upon request by a minor's legal guardian or custodian, or on the minor's 18th birthday,\u00a0unblock the minor's blocked report; and (2) if a\u00a0minor consumer was a victim of fraud or identity theft before the minor's\u00a018th birthday, include an alert statement in the minor's unblocked report. With respect to\u00a0a minor consumer who was a victim of fraud or identity theft prior to the minor's 18th birthday, a consumer reporting agency may not charge a fee to create, convert, or unblock the minor's report.\n\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau must establish specified procedures\u00a0related to\u00a0the bill's implementation."
