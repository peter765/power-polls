This bill amends the Fair Credit Reporting Act to require a consumer reporting agency, upon request by the legal guardian or custodian of a minor consumer, to either create a blocked credit report for the minor or convert the minor's existing report to blocked status. With respect to a minor's blocked report, a consumer reporting agency: (1) must block the input of any information, except with permission from the minor's legal guardian or custodian; and (2) may not provide any person with a consumer report of the minor.

A consumer reporting agency shall: (1) upon request by a minor's legal guardian or custodian, or on the minor's 18th birthday,&#160;unblock the minor's blocked report; and (2) if a&#160;minor consumer was a victim of fraud or identity theft before the minor's&#160;18th birthday, include an alert statement in the minor's unblocked report. With respect to&#160;a minor consumer who was a victim of fraud or identity theft prior to the minor's 18th birthday, a consumer reporting agency may not charge a fee to create, convert, or unblock the minor's report.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau must establish specified procedures&#160;related to&#160;the bill's implementation.</summary>
