This bill requires the Department of Labor to award grants to employers to partner with community colleges to create programs for training individuals for new jobs with such employers.

A "new job" is defined as a job that:

 may include a new position within an existing job category that is not a job of a recalled worker, a replacement job, or any other job that existed in the employer's business in the year preceding the date of hire; is not a job that existed in a business operation or substantially similar business operation of the employer formerly located in another location that was closed or substantially reduced by the employer; and results in a net increase in employment for the employer.</summary>
