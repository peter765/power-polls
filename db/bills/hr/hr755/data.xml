This bill amends the REAL ID Act of 2005 to repeal the requirements that each state, in the issuance of drivers' licenses and identification cards: (1) retain paper copies of source documents for 7 years or images of source documents for 10 years, and (2) provide to all other states electronic access to information contained in the state's motor vehicle database.

The Department of Homeland Security shall extend through October 10, 2017, the deadline for compliance with the minimum document requirements and issuance standards for federal recognition of state drivers' licenses or identification cards for a state not in compliance that has received a limited extension of the deadline for compliance or that is under review for compliance as of the enactment of this bill.

The Department of of Homeland Security shall report on each state's compliance with the requirements of the material compliance checklist for such Act.</summary>
