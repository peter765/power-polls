Security Council to secure support for a resolution imposing multilateral sanctions against Hamas's use of human shields.\n\nThe President shall prohibit property transactions and U.S. entry with respect to: (1) each foreign person or entity that is a member of or acting on behalf of Hamas and that is responsible for or complicit in Hamas' use of human shields; and (2) each foreign person or entity and each agency or instrumentality of a foreign state that has significantly facilitated any act with respect to such use of human shields, provided material support to a listed person or entity, or attempted to facilitate or support such acts or persons.\n\nThe President may waive a sanction for 120 days with prior congressional certification that such waiver is vital to U.S. national security interests."
