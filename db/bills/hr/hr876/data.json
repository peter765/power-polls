    "text": "Aviation Employee Screening and Security Enhancement Act of 2017\n\nThis bill directs the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to submit a cost and feasibility study of a statistically significant number of Category I, II, and X airports to ensure that all airport employee entry and exit points leading to secure airport areas are comprised of:\n\n a secure door utilizing card and pin entry or biometric technology; surveillance video recording capable of storing video data for at least 30 days; and certain advanced screening technologies. The TSA shall:\n\n work with air carriers and airport operators, vendors, and concessionaires to enhance security awareness of credentialed airport workers regarding insider threats to aviation security and best practices related to airport access controls; assess credentialing standards, policies, and practices to ensure that such threats are adequately addressed; and require the application for a credential granting access to the Secure Identification Display Area of an airport to include the individual's social security number in order to strengthen security vetting effectiveness. The TSA also shall:\n\n work with airport operators to identify advanced technologies for securing employee access to secure and sterile airport areas; ensure that credentialed aviation workers are continuously vetted through the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Rap Back Service in order to more rapidly detect and mitigate insider threats; identify ways to enhance TSA's ability to educate its personnel on insider threats to aviation security and mitigate such threats; increase covert testing of TSA employee screening operations at airports and measure security effectiveness; establish a national database of TSA employees who have had either their airport or aircraft operator-issued badge revoked for failure to comply with aviation security requirements; and submit a plan for recurring reviews of the security controls for TSA information technology systems at airports."
