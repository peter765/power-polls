This bill amends the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act to: (1) cover debt owed to a state, and (2) specify that existing limits on&#160;civil damages awarded for abusive practices by a debt collector shall be adjusted for inflation.

A court may award injunctive relief for violations of the Act.

The Department of the Treasury may not contract with any debt collector or other private party to recoup overpayments of disaster assistance made to an individual or household by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act.</summary>
