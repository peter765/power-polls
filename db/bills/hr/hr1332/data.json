    "text": "Early Childhood Nutrition Improvement Act\n\nThis bill amends the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act to revise several provisions related to the child and adult care food program.\n\nUnder current law: (1)\u00a0an institution that provides child or day care under the program may be reimbursed for up to two meals and one supplement per day per child; and (2)\u00a0a\u00a0family or group day care home sponsoring organization may receive the same\u00a0maximum reimbursement, but\u00a0only with respect to a child maintained in a child care setting for at least eight hours per day. The bill eliminates this distinction between institutions and sponsoring organizations, and increases maximum reimbursement for both to: (1) two meals and one supplement or one meal and two supplements per day per child; or (2) three meals and one supplement or two meals and two supplements per day per child, for each child maintained in a child care setting for at least eight hours per day.\n\nReimbursements to family or group day care home sponsoring organizations must be adjusted annually to reflect the Consumer Price Index for food away from home, rather than the Consumer Price Index for food at home used under current law.\n\nA determination of a for-profit day care center's eligibility to participate in the program shall be in effect for six months.\n\nThe Department of Agriculture (USDA)\u00a0must issue guidance and, as appropriate, regulations to assist in ensuring a fair and effective process for the identification, review, and\u00a0correction of serious program deficiencies.\n\nUSDA\u00a0shall establish an advisory committee to examine the feasibility of reducing unnecessary or duplicative paperwork for those participating or seeking to participate in the program."
