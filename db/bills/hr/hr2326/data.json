In order to be eligible for membership on the commission, an individual must be a representative from: (1) nongovernmental organizations with expertise in the economy, energy, climate, or public health; or (2) industry organizations from relevant sectors.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office (GAO) must conduct a study of programs, financial tools, and institutions that are focused on: (1) reducing the level of greenhouse gas emissions; or (2) encouraging the research, development, prototyping, and deployment of energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies. The GAO must then report on: (1) the study results; and (2) an assessment of those financial tools, policies, and institutions that are most successful at reducing greenhouse gas emissions while protecting economic growth and employment."
