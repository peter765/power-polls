CBP shall make available to the public information collected on migrant deaths occurring along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nExcept in a national emergency or when required for specific counterterrorism duties, the Armed Forces may not assist in federal, state, and local and civilian law enforcement of immigration laws.\n\nDHS shall establish a Border Communities Liaison Office in every patrol sector at the southern and northern borders.\n\nThe bill prescribes requirements for enhanced border cooperation with Mexico, including in the areas of: (1) border security, (2) human trafficking and smuggling, (3) drug trafficking, (4) gang membership, and (5) violence and border deaths.\n\nDHS shall establish a Southern Border Security Task Force.\n\nThe bill establishes the Southern Border Security Commission.\n\nDHS shall:\n\n issue policies regarding the use of force by DHS personnel; establish standards for the conditions of confinement for children in CBP custody; and consider safety and family concerns in any action related to the repatriation or prosecution of individuals apprehended for immigration violations. DHS may not establish any new border crossing fees for individuals crossing at land ports of entry along the southern and northern borders.\n\nDHS must certify to Congress every six months, with specified exceptions, that it has only deported or otherwise removed a migrant from the United States through an entry or exit point on the southern border during daylight hours.\n\nDHS shall make specified increases to the total number of full-time CBP officers and support staff at U.S. land ports of entry by September 30, 2022.\n\nEach component of DHS shall comply with the Department of Justice Guidance for Federal Law Enforcement Agencies Regarding the Use of Race, Ethnicity, Gender, National Origin, Religion, Sexual Orientation, or Gender Identity."
