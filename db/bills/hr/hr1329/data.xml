Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 2017

 (Sec. 2) This bill directs the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to increase, as of December 1, 2017, the rates of veterans' wartime disability compensation, additional compensation for dependents, the clothing allowance for certain disabled veterans, and dependency and indemnity compensation for surviving spouses and children.

Each such increase shall be the same percentage as the increase in benefits provided under title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) of the Social Security Act, on the same effective date.

 The VA may adjust administratively, consistent with such increases, the rates of disability compensation payable to persons entitled to veterans benefits under public laws administered by the VA on December 31, 1958, who have not received benefits under provisions governing veterans compensation for service-connected disability or death.

(Sec. 3) The VA shall publish such increased rates in the Federal Register not later than the date on which certain social security increases are required to be published in FY2018.</summary>
