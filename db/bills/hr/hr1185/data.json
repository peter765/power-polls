An executive agency may except an offeror from such requirements if:\n\n the products needed for the contract are not manufactured in the United States in sufficient and reasonably available commercial quantities and are not of satisfactory quality; there is an unreasonable cost associated with the use of products substantially manufactured in, or services provided in, the United States; and/or the use of such products would be inconsistent with the public interest. If an agency determines that a contractor has submitted a false statement or violated any of the certification requirements, it shall terminate the contract and the contractor may not receive the preference for at least five years.\n\nThe Federal Acquisition Regulation shall be revised to implement the requirements of this bill."
