    "text": "(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on March 15, 2017. The summary of that version is repeated here.)\n\nCompetitive Health Insurance Reform Act of 2017\n\n(Sec. 2) This bill amends the McCarran-Ferguson Act to declare that nothing in that Act modifies, impairs, or supersedes the operation of antitrust laws with respect to the business of health insurance, including the business of dental insurance. This declaration does not apply to a contract, combination, or conspiracy to: (1) collect, compile, or disseminate historical loss data; (2) determine a loss development factor for historical loss data; (3) perform actuarial services if the collaboration does not involve a restraint of trade; or (4) develop or disseminate a standard insurance policy form if adherence to the form is not required.\n\nProhibitions against unfair methods of competition apply to the business of health insurance without regard to whether the business is for profit."
