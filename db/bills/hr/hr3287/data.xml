 This bill requires the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) to calculate a carbon score for legislation. The carbon score is the projected net greenhouse gas emissions that would result from: (1) enactment and implementation of a bill or resolution, and (2) the appropriation of any amounts authorized in the legislation.

The CBO must include the carbon score in cost estimates for reported legislation that are submitted to congressional committees pursuant to the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.</summary>
