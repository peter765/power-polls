Any devices provided in connection with such alternative service must be incapable of collecting such information.\n\nOperators may disclose such information only with the express consent of the consumer or as required by a court order in connection with a law enforcement investigation.\n\nViolations of this bill are to be treated as unfair or deceptive acts or practices under the Federal Trade Commission Act."
