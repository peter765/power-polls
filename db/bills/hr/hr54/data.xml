 The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) must report to Congress regarding the feasibility of establishing a DHS Civilian Cyber Defense National Resource.

The report must address:

 the number of persons who would be needed to defend the critical infrastructure of the United States from a cyber attack or man-made intentional or unintentional catastrophic incident; elements of DHS that would be best equipped to recruit, train, and manage such a resource; resources that could be pre-positioned and training that could be instilled to assure responsiveness if an incident disrupts communications in a region or area; the impact of potential recruits' lack of experience in military, intelligence, law enforcement, or government work experience; logistics of allowing governors to make requests of DHS to use such a resource in states during times of cyber emergency; and whether a resource trained to defend U.S. networks in a major attack or natural or man-made disaster will benefit overall efforts to defend the interests of the United States.</summary>
