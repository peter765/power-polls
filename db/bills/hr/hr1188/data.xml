  <summary date="2017-02-16T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Adam Walsh Reauthorization Act of 2017

This bill amends the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act to:

 reauthorize through FY2022 the Sex Offender Management Assistance program; reauthorize through FY2022 the activities of the U.S. Marshals Service to locate and apprehend sex offenders who violate sex offender registration requirements; reduce from 25 years to 15 years the required registration period for certain juvenile delinquent sex offenders who maintain a clean record; allow a state, Indian tribe, or territory to exempt from disclosure on a public website information about juvenile delinquent sex offenders; specify how to calculate the allocation of Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) program funds for local governments after a state's JAG funds are reduced for failure to comply with sex offender registration and notification standards; and establish an alternative method for complying with the in-person verification requirement. It amends the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006 to require the Department of Justice to include additional data in its annual report on the enforcement of sex offender registration requirements.

The bill amends the federal criminal code to:

 modify the duties of probation and pretrial services officers to include, when directed by a court, supervision of a sex offender conditionally released from civil commitment subject to court-ordered compliance with a prescribed regimen of medical, psychiatric, or psychological treatment; and extend the statute of limitations for a minor victim of a federal sex offense to file a civil action to 10 years (currently 3 years) from the date such individual reaches age 18.</summary>
