U.S. Wants to Compete for a World Expo Act

(Sec. 3) This bill calls for: (1) the United States to rejoin the Bureau of International Expositions (BIE) to promote global branding, domestic job creation, and U.S. tourism; and (2) the Department of State to facilitate the timely submission of a request to rejoin the BIE.

(Sec. 4) The bill authorizes the State Department to: (1) take necessary actions for the United States to rejoin the BIE, and (2) accept contributions for such purpose.

(Sec. 5) Nothing in this bill may be construed to authorize any obligation or expenditure prohibited by provisions of the Admiral James W. Nance and Meg Donovan Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 2000 and 2001 relating to limitations on the obligation or expenditure of funds by the State Department for a U.S. pavilion or exhibit at an international exposition or world's fair registered by the BIE. Such Act is amended to prohibit State Department employees in their official capacity from soliciting funds to pay expenses for such a U.S. pavilion or exhibit.</summary>
