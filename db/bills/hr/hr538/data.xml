(Sec. 3) This bill redesignates the Ocmulgee National Monument in Georgia as the Ocmulgee Mounds National Historical Park. The boundary of the park is adjusted to include approximately 2,100 acres.

 The Department of the Interior may acquire lands and interests within the boundaries of the park by donation, purchase from a willing seller, or exchange, but not by condemnation.

 Interior shall administer any acquired land as part of the park.

(Sec. 4) Interior shall conduct a special resource study of the Ocmulgee River corridor between the cities of Macon and Hawkinsville, Georgia, to :

 evaluate the national significance of the study area; determine the suitability and feasibility of designating the study area as a unit of the National Park System; and consider other alternatives for the preservation, protection, and interpretation of the study area by the federal government, state or local government entities, or private and nonprofit organizations.</summary>
