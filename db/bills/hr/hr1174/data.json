The lactation room must be a hygienic place that is shielded from public view and free from intrusion and must contain a chair, a working surface, and an electrical outlet.\n\nA public building may be excluded from such requirement at the discretion of the official responsible for its operation if:\n\n it does not contain a lactation room for employees and does not have a space that could be repurposed as one or that could be made private by using portable materials, at a reasonable cost; or the cost of new construction required to create a lactation room is not feasible."
