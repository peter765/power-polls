  <summary date="2017-03-07T13:44:07Z" status="Passed House amended">Fairness For Breastfeeding Mothers Act of 2017

(Sec. 2) This bill requires certain public buildings that have a public restroom&#160;to provide a lactation room, other than a bathroom, that is available for use by members of the public to express milk. The lactation room must be a hygienic place that is shielded from public view and free from intrusion and must contain a chair, a working surface, and an electrical outlet.

A public building may be excluded from such requirement at the discretion of the official responsible for its operation if:

 it does not contain a lactation room for employees and does not have a space that could be repurposed as one or that could be made private by using portable materials, at a reasonable cost; or the cost of new construction required to create a lactation room is not feasible.</summary>
