(Opportunity scholarships are provided to low-income DC students to enable them to attend a participating private school of their choice.)\n\nThe bill also amends the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act to allow states that have established a program which allows the parents of disabled children to use public or private funds for assistance with the cost of their children attending a private school, to supplement those funds with their allocation of federal special education funds.\n\nThe bill authorizes grants to support the design and initial implementation of state programs that allow the parents of a disabled child to make a choice of the appropriate public or private school for their child.\n\nThe Department of Defense (DOD)must carry out a five-year pilot program to award scholarships to enable military dependent students who live on military installations to attend the public or private elementary or secondary schools their parents choose.DOD must select at least five military installations to participate in the program and choose those where military students would benefit from expanded education options.\n\nThe Department of Education must return to the Treasury specified amounts made available for salaries and expenses."
