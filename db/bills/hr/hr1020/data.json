The sponsor of a clinical trial may voluntarily disclose, collect, or report such information to the FDA.\n\nExcept in the case of gross negligence or willful misconduct, a person who manufactures, imports, distributes, prescribes, or administers such a drug or device is not liable under state or federal law for loss, damage, or injury from the development, testing, production, acquisition, use, safety, or effectiveness of the drug or device."
