This bill amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to prohibit an individual holding federal office from soliciting funds directly from any person: (1) for or on behalf of any political committee, or (2) for or on the behalf of any person for use for federal election activity.

Such an individual, however, may participate in a fundraising event, including planning or attending it, speaking at it, or serving as a featured guest at the event, so long as he or she does not engage in any written or verbal solicitation of funds in connection with the event.</summary>
