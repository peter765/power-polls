Supports the designation of the Department of Defense Laboratory Day in celebration of the work of the national network of laboratories and engineering centers of the U.S. Armed Forces.

Recognizes: (1) that a key to maintaining Armed Forces superiority, innovation, and competitiveness in a global economy is to continue to support federally sponsored research and development; and (2) such network's scientists, technicians, and support staff.

Acknowledges that the knowledge base, technologies, and techniques generated in such network serve as a foundation for additional efforts relating to the Armed Forces in the defense industrial base. Commits to finding ways to increase investment in such network.

Encourages such network, federal agencies, and Congress to hold an outreach event on May 18, 2017.</summary>
