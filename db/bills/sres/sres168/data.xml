  <summary date="2017-05-17T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Condemns: (1) killings of peaceful protesters and excessive use of force by Ethiopian security forces; (2) the detention of journalists, students, activists, and political leaders who exercise their constitutional rights to freedom of assembly and expression through peaceful protests; and (3) abuse of the Anti-Terrorism Proclamation to stifle political and civil dissent and journalistic freedoms.

Urges protesters in Ethiopia to refrain from violence and from encouraging or accepting violence in demonstrations.

Calls on the government of Ethiopia to take specified steps, including to fully lift the state of emergency, end the practice of excessive force by security forces, grant the United Nations (U.N.) High Commissioner for Human Rights and U.N. Special Rapporteurs full access to conduct a comprehensive independent examination of the state of human rights in Ethiopia, and repeal proclamations that can be used to harass individuals or organizations engaging in peaceful political dissent or that prohibit funding for civil society organizations working for respect for constitutional rights, the rule of law, and protection of human rights.

Calls on: (1) the Department of State to share with Congress the results of a review of security assistance and improve oversight of U.S. assistance to Ethiopia; (2) the U.S. Agency for International Development to lead efforts to develop a strategy to support improved democracy and governance in Ethiopia; and (3) the President to apply appropriate sanctions on foreign persons or entities responsible for extrajudicial killings, torture, or other gross violations of internationally recognized human rights committed against any nationals in Ethiopia.

Supports the peaceful efforts of the Ethiopian people to exercise their constitutional rights.</summary>
