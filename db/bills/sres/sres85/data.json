Notes that repeated pledges by Iranian officials to provide their government's assistance have not led to any meaningful progress in locating or returning him.\n\n Urges the government of Iran to take meaningful steps towards fulfilling its promises to assist in locating and returning Levinson, including immediately providing all information from all entities of such government regarding his disappearance.\n\n Urges the President and U.S. allies to continue to press the Iranian government to locate and return Levinson, notwithstanding disagreements with Iran on a broad array of issues. Notes that further delay in locating and returning Levinson remains a significant obstacle to improving U.S.-Iran relations.\n\n Expresses sympathy to Levinson's family and expresses hope that their ordeal can be brought to an end in the near future."
