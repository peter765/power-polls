Recognizes individuals in the United States and around the world, including women human rights defenders and civil society leaders, who have worked to ensure that women are guaranteed equality and basic human rights.

Recognizes the unique cultural, historical, and religious differences throughout the world and urges the U.S. government to act with respect and understanding toward legitimate differences when promoting any policies.

Reaffirms the commitment to: (1) end discrimination and violence against women and girls, and ensure their safety and welfare; (2) pursue policies that guarantee the basic human rights of women and girls worldwide; and (3) promote women's participation in every aspect of society and community.
