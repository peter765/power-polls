Reaffirms the U.S. commitment to support the Egyptian government with assistance, training, and other resources as it combats terrorism, addresses security in the Sinai Peninsula, and enhances Egypt's border security and maritime security. Declares that any proposed restructuring of U.S. assistance to Egypt will take into account progress on meaningful political reform, human rights, and fundamental freedoms.
