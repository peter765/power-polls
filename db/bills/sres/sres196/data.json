Security Council Resolution 1701 (calling for the disarmament of all armed groups in Lebanon).\n\nRecognizes the Lebanese Armed Forces as the sole institution entrusted with the defense of Lebanon's sovereignty, and supports U.S. partnerships with the LAF, particularly through the global coalition to defeat the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria."
