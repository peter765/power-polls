  <summary date="2017-06-21T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Recognizes the importance of bilateral U.S. assistance to the government of Lebanon in building its capacity to provide services and security and curbing Hizbollah's influence.

Encourages coordination between the Department of State, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, and humanitarian organizations to ensure that refugees from the conflict in Syria are supported so as to mitigate any adverse effect on their host countries.

Recognizes that it is in the interest of the United States to seek a negotiated end to the conflict in Syria that includes the ultimate departure of Bashar al-Assad, which would allow for the eventual return of the millions of Syrian refugees in Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey, and other countries.

Supports full implementation of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701 (calling for the disarmament of all armed groups in Lebanon).

Recognizes the Lebanese Armed Forces as the sole institution entrusted with the defense of Lebanon's sovereignty, and supports U.S. partnerships with the LAF, particularly through the global coalition to defeat the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria.</summary>
