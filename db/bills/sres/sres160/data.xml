Recognizes, on the 75th anniversary of the establishment of the U.S. Army military working dog program: (1) the service that military working dogs and contract working dogs (war dogs) have provided to the Armed Forces, and (2) that not all war dogs were given due recognition by being allowed to retire honorably from service.

Honors the sacrifices made by war dogs in combat and the services war dogs provide in retirement to members of the Armed Forces.</summary>
