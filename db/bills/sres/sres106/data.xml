  <summary date="2017-03-30T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Supports the U.S. Stimson Doctrine to not recognize territorial changes effected by force, and affirms that this policy should continue to guide U.S. foreign policy.

 Condemns Russia's military intervention and occupation of Georgia and its continuous illegal activities along the occupation line in Abkhazia and Tskhinvali region/South Ossetia.

 Calls upon the governement of Russia to: (1) withdraw its recognition of Georgia's territories of Abkhazia and the Tskhinvali region/South Ossetia as independent countries, (2) refrain from acts and policies that undermine Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and (3) take steps to fulfill the August 12, 2008, Ceasefire Agreement between Georgia and the Russian Federation.

Urges the United States to declare that it will not recognize Russian de jure or de facto sovereignty over any part of Georgia, including Abkhazia and the Tskhinvali region/South Ossetia.

Urges the President to: (1) deepen cooperation with Georgia, including Georgia's advancement towards Euro-Atlantic integration; and (2) place emphasis on enhancing Georgia's security through joint military training and the provision of self-defensive capabilities.

Affirms that a free, united, democratic, and sovereign Georgia is in the long-term U.S. interest.</summary>
