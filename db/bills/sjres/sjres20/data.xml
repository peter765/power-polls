This joint resolution proposes a constitutional amendment declaring that: (1) the rights enumerated in the Constitution and other rights retained by the people are the rights of natural persons; (2) the terms "people," "person," and "citizen" as used in the Constitution do not include corporate entities established by the laws of any state, the United States, or any foreign state; and (3) corporate entities are subject to such regulation as the people, through representatives in Congress and state representatives, may determine reasonable, consistent with the powers of Congress and the states.

The amendment prohibits the Constitution from being construed to limit such rights enumerated in the Constitution and other rights retained by the people, which are unalienable.</summary>
