  <summary date="2017-03-02T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Authorization for Use of Military Force Against al-Qaeda, the Taliban, and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria

This joint resolution authorizes the President to use all necessary and appropriate force against al-Qaeda, the Taliban, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), successor organizations, and associated forces. Such authority includes the authority for the Armed Forces to detain, pending disposition under the law of war, persons who are a part of or who substantially supported such entities.

Congress declares that this joint resolution constitutes specific statutory authorization within the meaning of the War Powers Resolution to introduce U.S. Armed Forces into hostilities or into situations wherein involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances.

The President must submit to specified congressional committees a comprehensive strategy to defeat ISIS, detailing specified elements, including: (1) national security interests threatened by ISIS, (2) strategic and operational objectives, (3) risks, and (4) an end-state and exit strategy.

The President must submit to Congress a report on matters relevant to this joint resolution, including actions taken pursuant to the exercise of authority granted by this resolution, at least every 60 days.

The bill repeals: (1) the Authorization for Use of Military Force (enacted September 18, 2001), and (2) the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002.</summary>
