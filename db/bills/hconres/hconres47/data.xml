  <summary date="2017-04-05T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Expresses the sense of Congress that:

 President Trump, his family, his business associates, his campaign associates, and members of his Administration should cooperate fully with all investigations examining the Russian Federation's attack during the 2016 U.S. elections, ties between President Trump's campaign officials and the Russian Federation, and possible coordination between these officials and the Russian Federation as part of its attack; until the conclusion of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's criminal and counterintelligence investigation, the Trump Administration is acting under the appearance of a conflict of interest and should refrain from taking any actions or making any changes to U.S. policy that could be seen as benefitting President Putin or his inner circle; and the appearance of any conflict of interest concerning a foreign adversary and U.S. government institutions primarily responsible for national defense and the conduct of foreign policy weakens U.S. national security and erodes confidence between the United States and its allies.</summary>
