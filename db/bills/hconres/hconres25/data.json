Among the order's major provisions are restrictions on the entry of immigrants and nonimmigrants from seven countries (Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen) and additional limitations on refugee admissions to the United States.\n\nDeclares that:\n\n the President must immediately allow for the continued entry of refugees that have already been granted admission to the United States by the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program; the United States should continue to resettle refugees that need protection, and lawful permanent residents should be granted entry into the United States, regardless of their country of origin; and the Visa Interview Waiver Program should not be suspended while the Department of State conducts a review of all nonimmigrant visa reciprocity agreements to ensure that there are no disruptions to communities, institutions of education, and interstate commerce."
