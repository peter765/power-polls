  <summary date="2017-02-28T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that infrastructure spending bills enacted during the 115th Congress should include: (1) investments in workforce development programs to recruit and train unemployed veterans that have served in a conflict since September 11, 2001, and individuals from communities with high unemployment rates; and (2) outreach efforts geared toward underrepresented contractors, including minority- and women-owned businesses, veteran owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran owned small businesses, and offerors that employ veterans on a full-time basis.</summary>
