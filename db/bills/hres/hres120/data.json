Robart of the Western District of Washington ignored the Constitution, federal law, and court precedent in issuing a temporary restraining order against Executive Order 13769, entitled \"Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States\"; and (2) the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit erred in failing to reverse Judge Robart's order. Among the executive order's major provisions are restrictions on the entry of immigrants and nonimmigrants from seven countries (Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen) and additional limitations on refugee admissions to the United States."
