Notes that the Colombian Action Plan Related to Labor Rights, signed on April 7, 2011, has not adequately strengthened or improved working conditions in Colombia.\n\n Recognizes that Colombian flower workers should not suffer harm from free trade but should share in its economic benefits.\n\nEncourages the development and implementation of new measures to uphold and fulfill the strong labor commitments made under the U.S.-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement."
