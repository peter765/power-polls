  <summary date="2017-02-13T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Expresses support for: (1) the designation of International Flower Workers' Day to demonstrate the U.S. commitment to practices that respect labor rights in other countries, and (2) the elimination of exploitative labor practices as a key U.S. policy goal.

Urges the governments of Colombia and other flower-producing countries to investigate and respond to the social and environmental impacts of the flower-producing industry. Notes that the Colombian Action Plan Related to Labor Rights, signed on April 7, 2011, has not adequately strengthened or improved working conditions in Colombia.

 Recognizes that Colombian flower workers should not suffer harm from free trade but should share in its economic benefits.

Encourages the development and implementation of new measures to uphold and fulfill the strong labor commitments made under the U.S.-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement.</summary>
