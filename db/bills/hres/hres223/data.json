Commends the South Korean government for its commitment to and cooperation in the effective deployment of THAAD.\n\nCondemns China's retaliatory measures against South Korea in response to such deployment.\n\nUrges the Chinese government to: (1) immediately cease its diplomatic intimidation and economic coercion against South Korea, and (2) pressure North Korea to give up its nuclear and ballistic missile programs instead of undermining South Korea's sovereign right to defend itself."
