  <summary date="2017-01-12T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Honors: (1) those who lost their lives in Haiti due to the earthquake on January 12, 2010, and Hurricane Matthew in October 2016; and (2) the sacrifice of the men and women of the government of Haiti, the U.S. government, the United Nations (U.N.), and the international community for their response to those affected by these calamities.

Expresses solidarity with the people of Haiti as they work to prevent malnutrition and hunger, mitigate the effects of climate change, and rebuild their homes, neighborhoods, livelihoods, and country.

Reaffirms the commitment of the House of Representatives to support long-term Haitian development and disaster preparedness.

Supports the Administration's efforts to: (1) increase food security in Haiti through sustainable agriculture programs; (2) shore up housing initiatives; (3) prevent the spread of cholera and treat persons who contract the disease; (4) provide technical assistance to the Haitian Ministry of Public Health and Population; and (5) improve water, sanitation, and health systems.

Urges the President and the international community to: (1) focus assistance on building the capacity of Haiti's public sector and reinforcing the systems it employs to provide basic services, (2) develop and improve communications and participatory mechanisms to more substantially involve Haitian civil society at all stages of post-disaster responses, and (3) give priority to programs that protect vulnerable populations.

Urges the President to: (1) make necessary resources available to U.S. and U.N. agencies, nongovernmental organizations, private volunteer organizations, and regional institutions; (2) support U.N. efforts to fully execute the U.N.'s new two-track response to eradicate cholera from Haiti and provide material assistance to those Haitians most directly affected; (3) lead humanitarian and development and disaster risk reduction efforts with the government of Haiti, the Haitian Diaspora, and international actors; (4) maximize responsible local and regional procurement; (5) improve the monitoring of U.S. government-funded aid programs; and (6) work with Haitian authorities and private landowners to prevent evictions of internally displaced person communities.</summary>
