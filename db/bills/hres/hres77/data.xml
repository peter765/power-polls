  <summary date="2017-01-31T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Encourages each corporate, academic, and social entity: (1) to develop an internal rule modeled after a successful business practice, such as the Rooney Rule (requires every National Football League team with a coach or general manager opening to interview at least one minority candidate) or the RLJ Rule (encourages companies to voluntarily establish a best practices policy to identify minority candidates and vendors by implementing a plan to interview at least two qualified minority candidates for managerial openings at the director level and above and to interview two qualified minority businesses before approving a vendor contract); (2) in accordance with title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, to adapt that rule to specifications that will best fit the procedures of the individual entity; and (3) to institute such individualized rule to ensure that the entity will always consider candidates from underrepresented populations before selecting a business vendor or filling a leadership position.</summary>
