  <summary date="2017-06-15T13:35:22Z" status="Passed House without amendment">(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Expresses:

 gratitude to U.S. Capitol Police Special Agents Crystal Griner, David Bailey, and Henry Cabrera who placed themselves in harm's way to protect individuals when an armed gunman opened fire at a practice for the annual Congressional Baseball Game for Charity on June 14, 2017; appreciation for the courage and dedication of the U.S. Capitol Police; and thanks to the Alexandria Police Department, Alexandria Sheriff's Office, Alexandria Fire Department and other first responders to the scene. Reaffirms that an attack on any Member of Congress is an attack on every Member, on the institution, and on representative democracy.

Stands firm in the belief that violence has no place in a pluralistic society.</summary>
