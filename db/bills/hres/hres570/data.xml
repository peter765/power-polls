  <summary date="2017-10-12T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Affirms the Jewish people's historical connection to Jerusalem.

 Recognizes that the archaeological discoveries from the City of David, the site of ancient Jerusalem, present evidence of the millennia-old connection of Jerusalem to the Jewish people, and, by extension, to Christianity.

 Commends the government of Israel for protecting the freedoms of all faiths in Jerusalem including Jews, Christians, and Muslims, and ensuring their access to holy sites so that they may worship freely.

 Condemns efforts by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) to delegitimize Israel through attempts to rewrite and deny Jerusalem's history.

 Encourages the United States to continue working with allies to prevent UNESCO from passing biased anti-Israel resolutions in the future.</summary>
