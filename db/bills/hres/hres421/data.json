Urges governments in affected African countries to:\n\n establish effective cease-fires and use force thereafter only when government forces or facilities or civilians are under attack; identify and take actions against individuals and entities that actively threaten peace and safety; work with civil society to help end conflict at the grassroots level and effect reconciliation; take specifed actions to promote the delivery of food, clean water, medicine, and shelter; protect humanitarian aid workers; and safeguard agricultural areas and farm personnel."
