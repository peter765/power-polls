  <summary date="2017-06-28T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Calls for the U.S. government to:

 use all available leverage to achieve lasting, comprehensive cease-fires in cases of conflict in Africa; work with governments to facilitate disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration of combatants; use the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act to sanction individuals or entities responsible for initiating or prolonging conflict, endangering humanitarian aid workers, or preventing delivery of humanitarian aid; apply all available weather and crop information to more accurately predict incipient drought and to determine the likelihood of famine in conflict areas; collaborate with other donor nations to accelerate the provision of food, clean water, medicine, and shelter to those in need; expand the prepositioning of aid commodities in safe zones close to the famine region; provide assistance to farmers, herders, and fishermen; and use cash transfers to more quickly provide food aid where local markets exist and to support the functioning of local markets. Urges governments in affected African countries to:

 establish effective cease-fires and use force thereafter only when government forces or facilities or civilians are under attack; identify and take actions against individuals and entities that actively threaten peace and safety; work with civil society to help end conflict at the grassroots level and effect reconciliation; take specifed actions to promote the delivery of food, clean water, medicine, and shelter; protect humanitarian aid workers; and safeguard agricultural areas and farm personnel.</summary>
