 the state of emergency in The Gambia should be resolved with the peaceful installation of President Barrow; Economic Community of Western African States peacekeeping forces should continue humanitarian work in conjunction with the Gambian military to ensure security for President Barrow's transition to authority; President Barrow should seek to preside over The Gambia with a steady hand, with high regard for human rights, and through promotion of the free press; and the peaceful transition of power is a tradition that must be upheld across the globe following all free and open election proceedings.</summary>
