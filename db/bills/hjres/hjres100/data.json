If the President exercises such authority to deploy ground forces in a combat role, the President shall notify Congress at the earliest possible date after such deployment consistent with U.S. national security interests.\n\nA joint resolution introduced on or after such notification that provides for modification or repeal of a deployment authority shall be considered to be in accordance with applicable procedures under the War Powers Resolution.\n\nSpecified prior authorizations for the use of military force are repealed."
