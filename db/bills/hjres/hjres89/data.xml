This joint resolution: (1) authorizes the President to use all necessary and appropriate force against al-Qaeda, the Taliban, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), successor organizations, and associated forces; and (2) grants specific statutory authorization to introduce U.S. Armed Forces into hostilities or into situations wherein involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances, within the meaning of the War Powers Resolution.

Such grant of authority includes the authority for the Armed Forces to detain, pending disposition under the law of war, persons who are a part of or substantially supported al-Qaeda, the Taliban, ISIS, any successor organization, or any associated force of those organizations.

The President must submit to specified congressional committees a comprehensive strategy to defeat ISIS, detailing specified elements.

The President must submit to Congress a report on matters relevant to this joint resolution, including actions taken pursuant to the exercise of authority granted by this resolution, at least every 60 days.

The bill repeals: (1) The Authorization for Use of Military Force (September 18, 2001), and (2) The Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002.</summary>
