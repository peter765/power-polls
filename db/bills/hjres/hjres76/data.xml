Interstate Compact

(Sec. 1) This joint resolution grants congressional consent and approval for the Commonwealth of Virginia, the state of Maryland, and the District of Columbia to enter into a Metrorail Safety Commission (MSC) Interstate Compact.

The MSC Compact establishes a Washington Metrorail Safety Commission for the safety oversight of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) Rail (Metrorail) system.

The commission shall:

 distribute a written State Safety Oversight Program; enforce implementation of WMATA's Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan, as well as audit triennially WMATA's compliance with such plan; enforce implementation of any Corrective Action Plans; enforce relevant federal and state laws and regulations relating to Metrorail safety; publish annually a Metrorail safety report, including updates of Corrective Action Plans, Commission directives, and on-going investigations; and publish annually a report on commission operations. An independent annual audit shall be made of commission financial accounts.

Any signatory may withdraw from the MSC Compact, which shall constitute its termination.</summary>
