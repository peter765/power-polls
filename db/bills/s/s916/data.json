The DEA may deny an application if it determines that the registration is inconsistent with the public interest.\n\nAn EMS agency may obtain a single registration in each state instead of a separate registration for each location.\n\nA registered EMS agency may deliver, store, and receive controlled substances, subject to specified conditions.\n\nAn EMS professional of a registered EMS agency may administer controlled substances in schedules II, III, IV, or V outside the physical presence of a medical director if such administration is authorized under state law and pursuant to a standing or verbal order, subject to specified conditions.\n\nThe bill specifies that a hospital-based EMS agency (i.e., an EMS agency owned or operated by a hospital) may continue to administer controlled substances under the hospital's DEA registration.\n\nA pharmacy may deliver a controlled substance to an administering practitioner in accordance with this bill's requirements, subject to specified conditions."
