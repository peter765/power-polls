This bill authorizes the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), if unable to furnish hospital care, medical services, or extended care at VA facilities or under other authorized contracts or sharing agreements, to enter into a Veterans Care Agreement (VCA) with an eligible provider to furnish such care and services.

The VA shall review VCAs exceeding $1 million annually at least once every two years.

The VA shall establish a process for the certification of eligible providers.

An eligible provider is:

 a physician or provider of services that has entered into a provider agreement under the Social Security Act; a provider of items and services receiving payments under a state Medicaid plan; an aging and disability resource center, an area agency on aging, or a center for independent living; or any other health care provider the VA considers appropriate. The VA shall establish a system or systems to monitor the quality of care and services furnished to veterans, which shall be used in assessing whether to renew a VCA.

A VCA may be made with a health care provider to provide veterans with nursing home care.</summary>
