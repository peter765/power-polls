This bill requires the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to carry out a program to assist veterans that have experienced or are experiencing domestic violence or sexual assault in accessing benefits from the VA, including by coordinating access to medical treatment centers, housing assistance, and other benefits. The VA shall carry out the program in partnership with specified health care or other service providers that serve domestic violence or sexual assault victims.

The VA may: (1) conduct training for community-based domestic violence or sexual assault service providers on identifying veterans who have been victims, coordinating with local VA service providers, and connecting veterans with appropriate VA housing, mental health, medical, and other financial assistance or benefits; and (2) provide assistance to service providers to ensure veterans access to domestic violence and sexual assault emergency services.

The VA may establish local coordinators to provide outreach under such program and ensure that each coordinator is knowledgeable about:

 the dynamics of domestic violence and sexual assault, including safety concerns, legal protections, and the need for confidential services; veteran eligibility for VA services and benefits relevant to recovery from domestic violence and sexual assault; and local community resources addressing domestic violence and sexual assault. Each coordinator shall assist domestic violence shelters and rape crisis centers in providing services to veterans.

The VA shall: (1) establish a national task force to develop a comprehensive national program to address domestic violence and sexual assault among veterans, and (2) conduct a national baseline study to examine the scope of the problem of domestic violence and sexual assault among veterans and spouses of veterans.</summary>
