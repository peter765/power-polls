Each coordinator shall assist domestic violence shelters and rape crisis centers in providing services to veterans.\n\nThe VA shall: (1) establish a national task force to develop a comprehensive national program to address domestic violence and sexual assault among veterans, and (2) conduct a national baseline study to examine the scope of the problem of domestic violence and sexual assault among veterans and spouses of veterans."
