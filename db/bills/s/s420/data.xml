This bill requires the President to report to specified congressional committees every 180 days on the Iranian government's use of commercial aircraft and related services for illicit military or other activities during: (1) the preceding five years, for the first report; and (2) the preceding 180 days, for any subsequent report. Such reports shall describe the extent to which:

 Iran's government has used commercial aircraft, including Iran Air, or related services to transport illicit cargo to or from Iran, including military goods, weapons, personnel, electronic parts and mechanical equipment, or rocket or missile components; the commercial aviation sector of Iran has provided support to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Iran's Ministry of Defense and Armed Forces Logistics, the Bashar al Assad Regime in Syria, Hezbollah, Hamas, Kata'ib Hezbollah, any other organization designated as a foreign terrorist organization under the Immigration and Nationality Act, or any person on the list of specially designated nationals and blocked persons maintained by the Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control; and foreign governments and persons have facilitated such activities. If the President determines in such a report that any Iranian commercial air carrier has used commercial aircraft for illicit military purposes on or after January 16, 2016, the President shall include the air carrier on such list.

This bill shall cease to be effective 30 days after the President certifies that the Iranian government has ceased providing support for acts of international terrorism.</summary>
