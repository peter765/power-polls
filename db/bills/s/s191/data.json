    "text": "Patient Freedom Act of 2017\n\nThis bill provides states with three options regarding title I (provisions on health insurance reform, exchanges, and subsidies) of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA): (1) continue implementing PPACA, with a limit on total premium and cost sharing subsidies provided in the state; (2) waive the requirements of title I of PPACA, with specified exceptions; or (3) the second option plus implementation of a Roth health savings account (HSA) deposit system. Only residents of states continuing to implement PPACA are eligible for PPACA premium subsidies.\n\nThe bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to set forth provisions regarding Roth HSAs, which have annual contribution limits and are not subject to taxes. Contributions to Roth HSAs are not tax deductible.\n\nIn states implementing a Roth HSA deposit system, residents who are enrolled in health insurance coverage that meets state standards receive monthly deposits in their Roth HSAs. States that administer deposits are entitled to payments from the Department of Health and Human Services for population health initiatives.\n\nStates with a Roth HSA deposit system must penalize residents who have a break in health coverage and may enroll residents in a default high deductible health plan that is continually available for enrollment.\n\nContributions may no longer be made to non-Roth HSAs.\n\nHSAs and Roth HSAs may be used to pay monthly or prepaid amounts for physician services. These services are not considered to be health insurance.\n\nThis bill amends SSAct title XVIII (Medicare) to require participating hospitals to limit costs to individuals for uncovered emergency medical care.\n\nPersons providing medical care must post prices."
