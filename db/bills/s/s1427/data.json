Specifically, under such a waiver, the governor's state may\u00a0consolidate, replace, or alter eligibility requirements for two or more specified federal assistance programs related to nutrition, housing, income, foster care and adoption, and other social and community services. The board must evaluate waiver applications on the basis of whether\u00a0a proposed project promotes employment, family stability, and financial literacy and savings with respect to program participants. Specified provisions are excluded from waiver authority.\n\nThe bill specifies waiver application requirements, deadlines and processes for\u00a0review of applications, and limitations on project funding."
