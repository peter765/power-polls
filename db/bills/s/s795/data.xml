This bill amends the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006 to include dual or concurrent enrollment and early college high school options as part of the Act's supported career technical education (CTE) programs. (Dual and concurrent enrollment programs and early college courses allow students to earn college credit while still in high school.)

The bill allows: (1) schools to use a portion of funding received under the Act for tuition and fees for CTE college courses, and (2) school districts to use such funding to support educators pursuing the credentials they need to teach these courses in their high schools.

The Department of Education may include in its demonstration and dissemination of best practices information on CTE programs methods and techniques for providing and integrating dual or concurrent enrollment, early college high schools, pre-apprenticeship programs, and other opportunities for secondary students to earn postsecondary education credit in CTE programs.</summary>
