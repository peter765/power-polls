Any land located within or adjacent to the boundaries of the park that is owned by Minnesota (or a political subdivision) may be acquired by Interior through donation or exchange only.\n\nUpon completion of any such acquisition from Minnesota, Interior shall revise the park's boundaries to reflect the acquisition."
