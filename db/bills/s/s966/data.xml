 This bill directs the National Park Service (NPS) to establish and maintain a National Historic Vehicle Register which shall include: (1) a narrative describing each historic vehicle and its historical significance, (2) a photographic record of the vehicle, and (3) a line drawing or engineering drawing of the vehicle. Such register shall be archived in the Library of Congress.

 The NPS shall: (1) coordinate with the Historic Vehicle Association, American Motorcycle Heritage Foundation, and other appropriate organizations in order to invite owners of historic vehicles to participate in the register; and (2) develop criteria for the inclusion of historic vehicles on the register.

 When developing such criteria, the NPS shall consider whether a vehicle is: (1) associated with an important event or a significant individual in automotive or U.S. history; (2) distinctive based on design, engineering, craftsmanship, or aesthetic value; or (3) of a particular type that was the first or last produced or among the most well-preserved or authentically restored examples of that type.</summary>
