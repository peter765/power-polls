Tribal Veterans Health Care Enhancement Act

(Sec. 2) This bill amends the Indian Health Care Improvement Act to permit the Indian Health Service (IHS) to pay copayments owed to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) by Indian veterans for medical services authorized under the Purchased/Referred Care program and administered at a VA facility.

(Sec. 3) The IHS, the VA, and tribal health programs, in consultation with impacted tribes, must enter into a memorandum of understanding that authorizes the IHS or a tribal health program to pay such copayments unless it would decrease the quality of, or access to, health care for individuals receiving care from the IHS or the VA.

The IHS and the VA must report on veterans who are eligible for IHS assistance and have received care from the VA.</summary>
