 This bill allows the receipt of both military retired pay and veterans' disability compensation with respect to any service-connected disability (under current law, such a disability must be rated as not less than 50% disabling).

 The bill makes eligible for the full concurrent receipt of both veterans' disability compensation and either military retired pay or combat-related special pay those individuals who were retired or separated from military service due to a service-connected disability.</summary>
