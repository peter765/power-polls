ED must: (1) test the form with representatives of students, students' families, institutions of higher education, secondary school and postsecondary counselors, and nonprofit consumer groups; and (2) use the results to develop the final form.\n\nEach institution of higher education that receives federal financial assistance under the Higher Education Act of 1965 must use the standard form when offering financial aid to students."
