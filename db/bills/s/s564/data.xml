  <summary date="2017-03-08T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Help Americans Never Get Unwanted Phone Calls Act of 2017 or the HANGUP Act 

This bill amends the Communications Act of 1934 and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 to repeal provisions that authorize the use of automated telephone equipment (robocall or robotext equipment) to call cellular telephones or residential telephone lines for the purpose of collecting debts owed to the U.S. government.

The bill also extends the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) to restrict government contractors and other legal entities from using such automated telephone equipment without prior consent of the called party. (Currently, government contractors are exempt from TCPA restrictions under a Federal Communications Commission declaratory ruling released on July 5, 2016.)</summary>
