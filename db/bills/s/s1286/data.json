The Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity (LIBERTAD) Act of 1996 is amended to eliminate provisions concerning:\n\n the enforcement of an economic embargo of Cuba; the prohibition on indirect financing of Cuba; opposition to Cuban membership in international financial institutions; opposition to ending Cuban suspension from the Organization of American States; certain import restrictions, including sugar restrictions; family remittance and travel to Cuba, news bureaus in Cuba, and extradition of persons sought by the Department of Justice for crimes committed in the United States; and assistance to a free and independent Cuba. The Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 is amended to:\n\n remove Cuba from the list of state sponsors of terrorism subject to agricultural and medical export restrictions; and repeal the prohibition on the U.S. entry of merchandise that is of Cuban origin, that is or has been located in or transported from or through Cuba, or that is made or derived in whole or in part of any article which is the growth, produce, or manufacture of Cuba."
