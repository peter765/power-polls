 This bill directs the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), upon an alien's application for an immigration benefit or the placement of such alien in an immigration enforcement proceeding, to:

 determine if the alien is serving, or has served, as a member of a regular or reserve component of the Armed Forces on active duty or as a member of a reserve component in an active status; and annotate every DHS immigration and naturalization record relating to such an alien to reflect such membership and to afford an opportunity to track the outcomes for each alien.</summary>
