This bill confirms that the boundary of Acadia National Park in Maine includes approximately 1,441 acres of land and interests in the Schoodic Peninsula.

The bill ratifies and approves:

 the acquisition by the United States of such land and interests, effective as of September 26, 2013, and any alteration of such land or interests held or claimed by the United States that occurred after such date. The Department of the Interior may only acquire land or interests in land within or outside of the boundaries of the park in Hancock or Knox Counties, Maine, in accordance with the statute that established the park's boundaries, except that Interior may conduct exchanges for lands and interests in accordance with the provisions relating to conveyances of certain property and interests in property acquired by Interior that are within units of the National Park System or related areas.

Interior shall contribute a specified amount to a regional consortium composed of units of local government on or in the vicinity of Mount Desert Island that was established to improve the management of the disposal and recycling of solid waste.

 Interior shall reestablish and appoint members to the Acadia National Park Advisory Commission.

 Certain land in the park that was conveyed by Interior to the town of Tremont, Maine, shall no longer be used exclusively for school purposes, but for public purposes, subject to the conditions that: (1) use of such land shall not degrade or adversely impact the park's resources or values; and (2) such land shall remain in public ownership for recreational, educational, or similar public purposes.

 Interior shall permit the harvesting of the marine organisms within the park according to the laws of the state of Maine and its local governments in order to allow for the continuation of traditional harvesting and aquaculture of clams, worms, mussels, periwinkles, and other marine organisms within intertidal areas in the park.

Interior shall convey to the town of Bar Harbor a specified .29-acre parcel of land within the park to be used for a solid waste transfer facility.</summary>
