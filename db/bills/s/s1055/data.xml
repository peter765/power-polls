  <summary date="2017-05-04T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Philippines Human Rights Accountability and Counternarcotics Act of 2017

This bill prohibits exporting defense articles or services, or issuing licenses for export of any item controlled by the United States for law enforcement, riot control, or related purposes, for use by the Philippine National Police or associated entities, with exceptions for the exportation of defense articles or the provision of training for maritime law enforcement, criminal justice programs, human rights training, or counter-terrorism programs for such police.

The President may, with prior congressional notice, waive such restrictions in the U.S. national interest.

The bill makes specified FY2017-FY2018 funds available to support human rights, democracy, and public health in the Philippines.

The Department of State shall report to Congress: (1) annually for five years regarding foreign assistance cases related to the Philippine National Police or associated entities submitted for vetting for having committed human rights violations; (2) annually regarding Chinese and other sources of narcotics production in the Philippines; (3) regarding whether U.S. military assistance and arms transfers provided for such police are used to commit human rights violations or have been used in violation of other U.S. laws applicable to military or security assistance; and (4) regarding partner capacity building assistance to the Philippines to enhance maritime capabilities, respond to emerging threats, and maintain freedom of operations in international waters and airspace in the Asia-Pacific maritime domains.</summary>
