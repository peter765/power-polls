This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code, with respect to the health care premium assistance refundable tax credit, to: (1) expand eligibility for the credit by defining an "applicable taxpayer" as a taxpayer whose household income for the year does not exceed 800% of the federal poverty line (currently 400%), (2) specify the applicable premium percentages for the credit for taxpayers with incomes that are from 400% to 800% of the federal poverty line, and (3) specify the dollar limitations for the recapture of excess advance payments of the credit from such taxpayers.</summary>
