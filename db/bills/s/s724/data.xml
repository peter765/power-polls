(Sec.1)This bill amends the Federal Power Act to authorize the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to issue a preliminary permit to a hydropower construction license applicant for up to four years, instead of three.

FERC may extend a preliminary permit once for no more than four years and may issue a new permit after the end of an extension if it determines there are extraordinary circumstances that warrant the issuance of an additional permit.

Additionally, FERC may extend the time a licensee has to commence construction on a project for up to eight years.Under current law, FERC may extend the license for no more than two years.</summary>
