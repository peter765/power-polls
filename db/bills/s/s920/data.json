The commission must report on: (1) HHS programs that focus on prevention, (2) current activities and gaps in federal efforts to support clinicians in providing integrated care, (3) improvement in federal education and awareness activities related to prevention and treatment, (4) methods for outreach and dissemination of education and awareness materials, and (5) opportunities for consolidation of overlapping federal programs.\n\nThe commission must submit an operating plan to HHS and Congress within 90 days of its first meeting. The commission is terminated after it submits a final report, but not later than the end of FY2021."
