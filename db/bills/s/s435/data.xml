This bill establishes the Interagency Council on Multigenerational Poverty to carry out specified objectives and the 2-generation approach, including by providing guidance, and addressing questions pertaining to 2-generation programs and other programs engaging in efforts to break the cycle of multigenerational poverty. The "2-generation approach" means the approach to breaking the cycle of multigenerational poverty by improving family economic security through the implementation of 2-generation pilot programs that create opportunities for, and address the needs of, parents and children together.

The council shall: (1) develop, make available for public comment, and submit to the President and Congress, a national strategic plan to end and prevent multigenerational poverty; (2) ensure that specified information is made available to the public and displayed on the official website of the council, including the strategic plan and certain information on the 2-generation programs; and (3) establish the 2-generation performance partnership pilot program and the 2-generation social impact bonds pilot program.

The Government Accountability Office must study and report on federal block grants under the jurisdiction of council participants to identify barriers and opportunities for collaboration in order to carry out the 2-generation approach.

The Office of Management and Budget shall designate lead agencies for purposes of carrying out the 2-generation programs.</summary>
