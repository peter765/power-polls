This bill urges urges Congress to provide robust funding of capitalization grants to states for the drinking water state revolving fund (DWSRF) and the clean water state revolving fund.

The bill amends the Safe Drinking Water Act to: (1) make the implementation of source water protection plans an eligible use of assistance from a drinking water state revolving fund; and (2) apply requirements about the qualifications-based selection of architects and engineers to contracts funded by state revolving funds, if the assistance is for a community with a population of more than 10,000 individuals.

The bill codifies the Environmental Protection Agency's WaterSense Program that allows water-efficient products, buildings, landscapes, facilities, processes, and services to bear a "WaterSense" label.

The bill amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (commonly known as the Clean Water Act) to revise and reauthorize through FY2021 the grant program for addressing combined sewer overflows, sanitary sewer overflows, and stormwater discharges.</summary>
