  <summary date="2017-02-27T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Ozone Regulatory Delay and Extension of Assessment Length Act of 2017 or the ORDEAL Act of 2017

This bill amends the Clean Air Act to lengthen from 5 years to 10 years the intervals at which the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is required to review and revise air quality criteria and primary and secondary national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS). This bill eliminates the EPA's authority to review and revise criteria or promulgate new standards for ozone concentrations earlier or more frequently than required. The EPA must delay until 2025 the enforcement and implementation of the rule entitled, "National Ambient Air Quality Standards for Ozone." No earlier than 2025, the EPA must initiate a new rulemaking to promulgate NAAQS for ozone concentrations.

The intervals at which an independent scientific review committee is required to review air quality criteria and NAAQS and recommend any new standards or revisions to existing criteria and standards are lengthened from 5 years to 10 years. The bill delays the review by an independent scientific review committee of NAAQS for ozone concentrations until 2025.</summary>
