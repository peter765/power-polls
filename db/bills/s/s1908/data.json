At the time of enrollment, exchanges must provide employers the names of employees and dependents that enroll in a qualified health plan for a year.\n\nIf a health insurance issuer or employer is unable to obtain the taxpayer identification number of a dependent, Treasury may permit the individual's full name and date of birth to be used instead.\n\nEmployers participating in the reporting system established by this bill are exempt from the requirement to report health insurance coverage information to the IRS by the end of the tax year."
