 This bill amends the Controlled Substances Act to modify the treatment of controlled substance analogues (i.e., substances that have substantially similar chemical structures and pharmacological effects to schedule I controlled substances).

Under current law, a controlled substance analogue that is intended for human consumption is treated as a schedule I controlled substance. This bill replaces the "intended for human consumption" qualifier with a "not a chemical substance subject to the Toxic Substances Control Act" qualifier. Specifically, a controlled substance analogue that is not a chemical substance under the Toxic Substances Control Act is treated as a schedule I controlled substance.</summary>
