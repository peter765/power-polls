This bill replaces the \"intended for human consumption\" qualifier with a \"not a chemical substance subject to the Toxic Substances Control Act\" qualifier. Specifically, a controlled substance analogue that is not a chemical substance under the Toxic Substances Control Act is treated as a schedule I controlled substance."
