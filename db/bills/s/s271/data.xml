This bill requires, for the five-year period beginning on October 1, 2020, the deposit of the first $21.4 billion of revenues collected by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection of the Department of Homeland Security into the Highway Trust Fund (HTF).

A state may enter into a state remittance agreement with the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), for a period of three years or longer, under which:

 it agrees to remit to the FHWA at least 60% of federal funds the state receives during each year of the agreement for federal-aid highway activities under the national highway performance program and the surface transportation block grant program; the FHWA agrees to provide the state with funds equal to 90% of the amount the state remitted to the FHWA; and the state agrees to use those funds to carry out core infrastructure projects in accordance with provisions that authorize the state to determine whether it is in compliance with federal project requirements regarding environmental approvals and permits, the use of only steel, iron, and manufactured products produced in the United States, project development and construction, preapproval for preventative maintenance, project agreements and modifications to such agreements, and consultant procurement services. The FHWA shall deposit ten percent of state-remitted funds into the HTF.</summary>
