  <summary date="2017-03-09T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow taxpayers who do not otherwise itemize their tax deductions&#160;a&#160;deduction from gross income&#160;(above-the-line deduction)&#160;for their&#160;employment-related expenses incurred in caring for a child under the age of 13 or a child who is physically or mentally incapable of self-care (qualifying child). The deduction is subject to annual limits of $7,000 for taxpayers with one qualifying child or $14,000 for taxpayers with two or more qualifying children. The bill allows an annual inflation adjustment to such amounts for taxable years beginning after 2017.</summary>
