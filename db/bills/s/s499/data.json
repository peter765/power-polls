Beginning, small, socially disadvantaged, young, or veteran farmers and ranchers are only required to pay 50% of the cost of planting the conserving using cover crop and are eligible for increased payments and crop insurance premium discounts under the program.\n\nA maximum of 15% of the eligible land on a farm may be enrolled in the program."
