The bill extends this requirement to state contracts with providers of\u00a0comparable primary care case management services\u00a0and other\u00a0health care services under Medicaid.\n\nWith respect to adults eligible for Medicaid and children enrolled in Medicaid or\u00a0CHIP, a state must report annually on quality measures identified by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). Such reporting shall be stratified by service delivery system.\n\nCMS shall establish a Medicaid Quality Performance Bonus fund to award states for high attainment and improvement on\u00a0a core set of quality measures. A state must designate at least 75% of any bonus funds for the development and operation of quality-related initiatives that will directly benefit providers or managed care entities participating in, or under a waiver of, the state plan for medical assistance. A state may use\u00a0the remainder of such\u00a0funds for activities related to the goals and purposes of the state plan."
