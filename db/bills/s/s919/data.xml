This bill prohibits a final agency rule from being published or taking effect until: (1) the agency submits the rule to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA), and (2) OIRA makes a determination as to whether the rule is a "high-impact rule" that may impose an annual cost on the economy of at least $1 billion.

An agency shall postpone the effective date of a high-impact rule until the final disposition of all actions seeking judicial review of the rule.</summary>
