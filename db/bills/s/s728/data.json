Any such project shall be located in a community affected by a recent decline in mining.\n\nA state or Indian tribe that receives funds under this bill may retain a portion of them as necessary to supplement its acid mine drainage abatement and treatment fund for future operation and maintenance costs for the treatment of acid mine drainage associated with individual projects.\n\nThe bill increases the minimum amount of funds that Interior must provide annually to states and Indian tribes for reclamation and restoration projects.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office must conduct a study on the use of funds authorized by this bill.\n\nThe Appalachian Regional Commission may provide grants to individuals or entities in the Appalachian region for projects that have been or that are eligible to be reclaimed or restored under SMCRA.The commission must relocate its headquarters from Washington, DC to the Appalachian region."
