This bill requires the Department of Defense (DOD) to ensure that: (1) its budget justification materials submitted to Congress include a description of how it will use funds to support any deliverables that the parties of the agreement between the Department of the Navy, the Defense Logistics Agency, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Region 9, and the State of Hawaii Department of Health, entered into on September 28, 2015, have identified as necessary to mitigate and prevent fuel leaks at the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility on Oahu, Hawaii; and (2) each future-years defense program describes how DOD will use funds to support deliverables that the parties to such agreement identified as necessary to mitigate and prevent such leaks.

The EPA must ensure that its budget justification materials submitted to Congress include a description of how it will use funds to support such deliverables.

DOD may obligate or expend specified amounts to carry out an unspecified minor military construction project for the sustainment and maintenance of the facility. DOD shall submit to the congressional defense committees written notice of any decision to carry out such project, including a justification for, and the estimated cost of, such project. The authority to carry out such project expires on September 30, 2030.</summary>
