  <summary date="2017-08-03T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Preserving Access to Manufactured Housing Act of 2017

This bill amends the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) to specify that a retailer of manufactured housing is generally not a "mortgage originator" subject to requirements under that Act. Similarly, the bill amends the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 to specify that such a retailer is generally not a "loan originator" subject to requirements under that Act.

In addition, the bill&#160;increases the annual percentage rates and transaction values at which&#160;mortgages for certain dwellings are considered "high-cost mortgages" under TILA.</summary>
