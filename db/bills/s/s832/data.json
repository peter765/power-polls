The Millennium Challenge Act of 2003 is amended to permit an eligible country that has entered into a Millennium Challenge Compact to enter into one additional compact under specified conditions.\n\nThe bill establishes, beginning with FY2013, new assistance criteria for a low-income or a lower-middle-income candidate country eligible to enter into a Millennium Challenge Compact with the United States.\n\nThe Millennium Challenge Corporation shall: (1) before selecting a compact country, provide the Board of Directors with information regarding the country's treatment of civil society; and (2) submit an assessment of the feasibility of developing partnerships at the subnational level within candidate countries."
