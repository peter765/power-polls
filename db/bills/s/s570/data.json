    "text": "Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act of 2017\n\nThis bill authorizes a number of programs to enhance weather forecasting and alerts at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\n\nNOAA's Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research must conduct a program to improve forecasting of weather events and their effects, with a special focus on high impact weather events.\n\nThe National Weather Service must collect and utilize information to make reliable and timely foundational forecasts of subseasonal and seasonal temperature and precipitation. Subseasonal forecasting is forecasting weather between two weeks and three months and seasonal forecasting is between three months and two years.\n\nThe bill provides for technology transfers between the National Weather Service and private sector weather companies and universities to improve forecasting.\n\nNOAA must complete and operationalize the Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (a weather satellite program which develops observational techniques using global navigation systems).\n\nAdditionally, NOAA may contract with the private sector to obtain data for weather forecasting.\n\nNOAA must continue its Environmental Information Services Working Group, which advises NOAA on weather research and opportunities to improve communications between weather stakeholders."
