Such training must: (1) be completed before the individual begins basic training or initial active duty for training in the Armed Forces, (2) meet such requirements as the Department of Defense establishes, and (3) be uniform across the Armed Forces.\n\nExpresses the sense of Congress that the training should be provided through in-person instruction and include instruction on the proper use of social media."
