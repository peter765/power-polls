    "text": "Authorized Rural Water Projects Completion Act\n\n This bill establishes the Reclamation Rural Water Construction and Settlement Implementation Fund, which shall consist of the Rural Water Project Account and the Reclamation Infrastructure and Settlement Implementation Account. The Department of the Treasury shall deposit into such accounts for each of FY2018-FY2038 specified revenues that would otherwise be deposited in the reclamation fund established by the Reclamation Act of 1902.\n\nThe bill permits the Department of the Interior to use specified Rural Water Project Account funds to complete construction of rural water projects: (1) authorized before this bill's enactment, or (2) for which a feasibility study was submitted by February 27, 2015, pursuant to the Rural Water Supply Act of 2006 and for which Congress authorizes construction after enactment of this bill. Interior may not expend any amounts from the fund to carry this out until development of: (1) programmatic goals that would enable the completion of construction of the authorized rural water projects as expeditiously as practicable and that reflect the priorities identified in the laws authorizing the projects; and (2) funding prioritization criteria to serve as a methodology for distributing funds that take into account specified factors, including the need for potable water supplies in the affected rural and tribal communities.\n\n Interior shall use specified Reclamation Infrastructure and Settlement Implementation Account funds to: (1) provide authorized compensation to resolve all monetary claims of an Indian tribe against the United States relating to use of tribal land by the United States for the generation of hydropower; or (2) complete projects and implement provisions authorized by Congress that resolve litigation involving the United States and the water rights of Indian tribes or that implement approved agreements limiting such rights."
