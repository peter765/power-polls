 This bill designates: (1) certain federal land in the Olympic National Forest in the state of Washington as wilderness and as components of the National Wilderness Preservation System; and (2) certain other land, identified on the same map as such proposed areas, as potential wilderness.

The bill amends the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to designate as wild, scenic, or recreational rivers specified segments of the following rivers in the state of Washington:

 Elwha River; Dungeness River; Big Quilcene River; Dosewallips River; Duckabush River; Hamma Hamma River; South Fork Skokomish River; Middle Fork Satsop River; West Fork Satsop River; Wynoochee River; East Fork Humptulips River; West Fork Humptulips River; Quinault River; Queets River; Hoh River; Bogachiel River; South Fork Calawah River; Sol Duc River; and Lyre River. The Department of Agriculture may take necessary measures to control fire, insects, and diseases in the wilderness areas designated by this bill.

 The federal land within the boundaries of the designated river segments is withdrawn from: (1) entry, appropriation, or disposal under the public land laws; (2) location, entry, and patent under the mining laws; and (3) disposition under all laws relating to mineral and geothermal leasing or mineral materials.</summary>
