 This bill amends the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to exclude from the meaning of "employee" subject to minimum wage and maximum hours requirements any individuals who volunteer their services at a children's consignment event with or without the assistance of a facilitator and meet certain other conditions.

 This bill defines "children's consignment event" to mean a sale or other event in which: (1) at least 90% of the aggregate fair market value of items offered for sale are children's or maternity clothing, and resale items are offered for sale on consignment; and (2) the event is held open to the public in a single location for the sale of goods for 8 or fewer sale days within any 30-day period.</summary>
