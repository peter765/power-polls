The bill reduces funding for the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) and prohibits the United States from running for a seat on UNHRC until the State Department certifies that UNHRC does not include a permanent item related to Israel or the Palestinian territories.\n\nThe bill states that it shall be U.S. policy to: (1) reject the premise in U.N. Security Council Resolution 2334 that Israel's establishment of settlements in the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967 constitutes a violation of international law, and (2) prohibit U.S. funding for any U.N. entity that attempts to enforce resolution 2334.\n\nThe bill requires reports on: (1) U.S. contributions to countries seeking to implement resolution 2334, (2) U.N. voting practices, and (3) anti-Semitic and anti-Israel activity at the U.N."
