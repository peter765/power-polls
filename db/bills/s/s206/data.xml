  <summary date="2017-01-24T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Jumpstart Our Businesses by Supporting Students Act of 2017 or the JOBS Act of 2017 This bill amends title IV (Student Assistance) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 to establish the Job Training Federal Pell Grant Program. The Department of Education must award job training Federal Pell Grants to eligible students.

An eligible student is one who does not have a degree, attends an institution of higher education (IHE), is enrolled in a job training program at such IHE, and meets all other eligibility requirements for a Federal Pell Grant.

The maximum job training Federal Pell Grant award is 50% of the discretionary base maximum award specified in annual appropriations law.

Any period during which a student receives a job training Federal Pell Grant counts toward that student's Federal Pell Grant eligibility period.</summary>
