  <summary date="2017-06-22T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Lavender Offense Victim Exoneration Act of 2017 or&#160;the LOVE Act of 2017

This bill requires the Department of State to review employee terminations at the State Department in the 1950s and 1960s to determine who was wrongfully terminated due to their actual or perceived sexual orientation (known as the Lavender Scare).

The bill contains an apology from Congress for its role in encouraging the termination of State Department employees based on sexual orientation.

The State Department is required to:

 create&#160;a reconciliation board to change the employment records of those affected, to receive oral testimony of those affected, and to allow former employees to bring a grievance if they believe their termination was due to their sexual orientation; create an advancement board to address employment issues of current LGBTQI Foreign Officers; establish a permanent exhibit about the terminations in the State Department's U.S.&#160;Diplomacy Center; report to Congress about countries refusing to issue visas to spouses of Foreign Service personnel because of&#160;&#160;their sexual orientation.</summary>
