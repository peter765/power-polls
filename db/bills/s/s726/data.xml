  <summary date="2017-03-27T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Gary Deloney and John Olsen Toxic Exposure Declassification Act

This bill directs the Department of Defense (DOD) to declassify documents related to any known incident in which at least 100 members of the Armed Forces were exposed to a toxic substance that resulted in at least one case of a disability that a member of the medical profession has determined is associated with that substance.

Such declassification shall be limited to information necessary for a potentially exposed individual to determine:

 whether that individual was exposed, the potential severity of the exposure, and any potential health conditions that may have resulted. DOD is not required to declassify documents if it determines that declassification would materially and immediately threaten U.S. security.</summary>
