Fertility counseling and treatment are included within authorized Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical services.\n\n The VA shall furnish such treatment and services to a jointly applying covered veteran and his or her spouse, partner, or gestational surrogate.\n\nThe VA may pay the adoption expenses (for up to three adoptions) for a covered member who is enrolled in the VA health care system.\n\n The VA shall facilitate research conducted collaboratively by DOD and the Department of Health and Human Services to improve the VA's ability to meet the reproductive health care needs of veterans who have a service-connected genitourinary disability or a condition that was incurred or aggravated in the line of duty that affects the veterans' reproductive ability.\n\n The VA shall enhance the capabilities of the VA women veterans contact center to: (1) respond to assistance requests, and (2) refer such veterans to federal or community resources.\n\n The pilot program of group retreat reintegration and readjustment counseling for women veterans recently separated from service is enlarged and extended.\n\n The bill provides child care assistance to qualified veterans for: (1) mental health care services, and (2) readjustment counseling and related mental health services."
