This bill amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to: (1) permit the use of Urban Area Security Initiative or the State Homeland Security Grant Program grant funds to protect a faith-based community center or vulnerable populations, including children or the elderly; and (2) define a "faith-based community center" as a facility operated by a nonprofit faith-based community organization for the provision of recreational, social, or education services to the general public.

The bill amends the federal criminal code to increase the term of imprisonment from 5 to 10 years for engaging in conduct with intent to convey false or misleading information that indicates that an activity has taken, is taking, or will take place that would constitute a violation of specified prohibitions, including certain prohibtions under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954.</summary>
