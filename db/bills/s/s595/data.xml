This bill amends the Anti-Border Corruption Act of 2010 to expand the categories of certain applicants for law enforcement positions with the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) for whom polygraph examinations may be waived.

An individual who receives a such a waiver and who holds a Tier 4 background investigation shall be subject to a Tier 5 single scope background investigation.

The CBP may administer a polygraph examination to an applicant for a law enforcement position who received a waiver if the CBP determines, based on information discovered before the completion of a background investigation, that a polygraph is necessary to make a final determination with respect to the suitability of the individual for the position.</summary>
