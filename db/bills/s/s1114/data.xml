  <summary date="2017-05-11T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This bill nullifies Executive Order 13798, entitled "Promoting Free Speech and Religious Liberty." The executive order: (1) requires the executive branch to enforce federal law protections for religious freedom and to protect persons and organizations that engage in religious and political speech; (2) prohibits the Department of the Treasury from taking adverse action against individuals, houses of worship, or religious organizations based on their speech about moral or political issues from a religious perspective, where speech of similar character has not ordinarily been treated as participation or intervention in a political campaign on behalf of, or in opposition to, a candidate for public office; and (3) requires Treasury, the Department of Labor, and the Department of Health and Human Services to consider issuing amended regulations to address conscience-based objections to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act's preventive-care mandate, which requires group health plans and health insurance issuers to provide coverage, and not impose cost sharing requirements, for contraception and other additional preventive care and screenings for women.</summary>
