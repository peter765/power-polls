(Sec. 1) This bill declares that the approximately one-acre portion of specified land transferred by the United States to Rockingham County, Virginia, that is used for purposes of a child care center, shall not be subject to the use restriction imposed in the deed for the transferred land.

The bill eliminates the requirement that the county include information concerning the use of the transferred land for a child care center in biennial reports to the Department of the Interior.</summary>
