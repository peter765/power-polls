 Grants may be used to:

 reimburse forensic science laboratories for efforts to address and prevent testing backlogs; reimburse law enforcement agencies for equipment to identify or detect heroin, fentanyl, and associated synthetic drugs; investigate, arrest, and prosecute distributors or sellers; and support health department services for users.</summary>
