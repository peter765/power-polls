These agreements must also provide training:\n\n through electronic resources, including Internet-based webinars, and at physical locations, including a small business development center (SBDC); and the headquarters or a regional office of the United States Patent and Trade Office. The bill amends the Small Business Act to require services at an SBDC to include training in person or through a website relating to:\n\n domestic and international intellectual property protections, and how those protections should be considered in the business plans and growth strategies of small businesses."
