This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to modify the tax treatment of qualified tuition programs (known as 529 plans).

The bill allows: (1) a nonrefundable tax credit for contributions of an individual to a 529 plan, and (2) an exclusion from the gross income of an employee of up to $1000 per year of employer contributions to a 529 plan.

The bill also permits savings from a 529 plan to be rolled over tax-free into: (1) a Roth Individual Retirement Account of the owner or the beneficiary of a 529 plan that has been maintained for 10 years, and (2) an ABLE account of the designated beneficiary of the 529 plan.

(Tax-favored ABLE [Achieving a Better Life Experience] accounts are designed to enable individuals with disabilities to save for and pay for disability-related expenses.)</summary>
