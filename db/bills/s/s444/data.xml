Supporting America's Innovators Act of 2017

(Sec. 2) This bill amends the Investment Company Act of 1940 to&#160;exempt from the&#160;definition of an "investment company," for purposes of&#160;specified limitations&#160;applicable to such&#160;a company&#160;under the Act,&#160;a qualifying venture capital fund that has no more than 250 investors. Specifically, the bill applies to a venture&#160;capital fund&#160;that has less than $10 million in aggregate capital contributions and uncalled committed capital.

Under current law, a venture capital fund is considered to be an investment company if it has more than 100 investors.</summary>
