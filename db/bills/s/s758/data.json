A veteran who served on active duty at Camp Lejeune for at least 30 days during such period is eligible for hospital care and medical services for any of the illnesses or conditions for which the evidentiary connection between toxic exposure and the illness or condition is categorized in such list as sufficient or modest. Such a veteran who has been furnished hospital care or medical services shall remain eligible for such care or services for such illness or condition even if the evidentiary connection is not categorized as sufficient or modest. A family member of such veteran who has been furnished hospital care or medical services shall remain eligible for hospital care or medical services for such illness or condition.\n\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs shall transfer for each of FY2017 and FY2018 specified finds to enhance the claims processing system, eligibility system, and web portal for the Camp Lejeune Family Member Program."
