Under current law, such employees and Members may make only one partial withdrawal upon reaching age 59-1/2 while employed or one withdrawal after retirement. The bill permits an unlimited number of such withdrawals.\n\nThe bill also eliminates: (1) the withdrawal election deadline (i.e., by April 1 of the year after the year in which the plan participant turns 70-1/2 or is separated from service); and (2) the limitation on age-based in-service withdrawals."
