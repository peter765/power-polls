    "text": "This bill amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to reauthorize the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP) through FY2021. SCAAP provides payments to state, local, and tribal governments to offset the costs of incarcerating certain undocumented criminal aliens.\n\nIt expands the definition of \u201cundocumented criminal alien\u201d to include an alien who has been charged with a felony or two or more misdemeanors.\n\nAdditionally, the bill directs the Department of Justice to reimburse a state, local, or tribal government for incarceration costs and medical expenses of a criminal alien whose immigration status cannot be verified by the Department of Homeland Security. (Currently, a criminal alien with lawful immigration status does not meet the criteria for SCAAP reimbursement.)"
