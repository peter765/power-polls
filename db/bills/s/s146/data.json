    "text": "Border Security Technology Accountability Act of 2017\n\nThis bill amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to require the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to: (1) ensure that each border security technology acquisition program that is determined to be a major acquisition program has an acquisition program baseline approved by the relevant acquisition decision authority; (2) document that each such program is meeting the cost, schedule, and performance thresholds specified in such baseline in compliance with relevant departmental acquisition policies and the Federal Acquisition Regulation; and (3) have a plan for each such program to meet program implementation objectives by managing contractor performance.\n\nThe Under Secretary for Management and the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection is required to ensure that border security technology acquisition program managers adhere to relevant internal control standards identified by the Government Accountability Office. The Commissioner shall provide information to assist the Under Secretary in monitoring proper program management of such acquisition programs.\n\nThe Under Secretary for Management, in coordination with the Under Secretary for Science and Technology and the Commissioner, shall submit a plan for testing and evaluation, and the use of independent verification and validation resources, for border security technology so that new border security technologies are evaluated through a series of assessments, processes, and audits to ensure: (1) compliance with relevant departmental acquisition policies and the Federal Acquisition Regulation, and (2) the effectiveness of taxpayer dollars.\n\n\"Major acquisition program\" means a DHS acquisition program that is estimated by DHS to require an eventual total expenditure of at least $300 million over its life cycle cost."
