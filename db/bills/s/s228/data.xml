This bill exempts for five years any small business broadband Internet access service provider with no more than 250,000 subscribers from the enhancements to the transparency rule of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) under which any person engaged in the provision of broadband Internet access service must disclose publicly accurate information regarding the network management practices, performance, and commercial terms of its broadband Internet access services sufficient for:

 consumers to make informed choices regarding their use; and content, application, service, and device providers to develop, market, and maintain Internet offerings. The FCC shall report to specified congressional committees, within 180 days after enactment of this bill, its recommendations (together with supporting data) on whether:

 this exception should be made permanent, and the definition of "small business" for these purposes should be modified.</summary>
