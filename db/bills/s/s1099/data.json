(Sec. 4) The OMB must issue guidance on improving information sharing by government agencies, including by:\n\n requiring relevant officials to identify and communicate information about high-risk activities; requiring appropriate agency officials to review the reports issued by charge card-issuing banks on questionable transaction activity and suspicious timing or amounts of cash withdrawals or advances; providing for the appropriate sharing of information related to potential questionable transactions, fraud schemes, and high risk activities with GSA and appropriate federal officials; and considering the recommendations made by Inspectors General or the best practices Inspectors General have identified. (Sec. 5) The GSA and the OMB must establish a purchase and travel charge card data management group to develop and share best practices.\n\n(Sec. 6) The GSA shall report on: (1) the implementation of this bill, including the metrics used in determining whether the analytic and benchmarking efforts have reduced, or contributed to the reduction of, questionable or improper payments, as well as improved utilization of card-based payment products; and (2) further potential savings opportunities for government agencies under the federal charge card programs.\n\nEach federal agency that issues and uses purchase cards and convenience checks shall report to the OMB on that agency's activities to implement this bill. The OMB must submit to Congress a consolidated report of agency activities to implement this bill."
