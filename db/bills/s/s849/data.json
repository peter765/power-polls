The grant program is expanded so that grants may be used to address emerging, infectious mosquito-borne diseases and to improve existing control programs. The CDC must give preference to applicants that have: (1) a public health emergency due to a mosquito-borne disease, or (2) a control program that is consistent with existing state preparedness plans. The requirement for matching funds may be waived if the area covered by a grant applicant has an extreme need due to the size or density of the human population, the size or density of the mosquito population, or the severity of the mosquito-borne disease.\n\nCDC grants to help public health agencies improve surveillance and response activities are extended through FY2022.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office must report on the surveillance and control of mosquito-borne infectious diseases in the United States and territories."
