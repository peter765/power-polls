Power And Security Systems (PASS) Act

This bill amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to require the Department of Energy to issue a rule by July 1, 2021, that determines whether energy conservation standards for external power supplies should be amended. The rule must contain any amended standards and apply to products manufactured on or after July 1, 2023.

Current law exempts external power supplies for security or life safety systems (e.g., smoke alarms) from energy conservation standards until July 1, 2017. This bill extends the exemption until July 1, 2023.</summary>
