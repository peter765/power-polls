The rule must contain any amended standards and apply to products manufactured on or after July 1, 2023.\n\nCurrent law exempts external power supplies for security or life safety systems (e.g., smoke alarms) from energy conservation standards until July 1, 2017. This bill extends the exemption until July 1, 2023."
