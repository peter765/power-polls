This bill directs the President to submit to Congress, every 180 days, a list of each foreign person that the President determines is responsible for or complicit in, or who acted as an agent for a foreign person in a matter relating to, detention, torture, or other denials of the right to life, liberty, or security of a person based on actual or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity.

 The Department of State shall issue public guidance relating to how names of foreign persons may be included on such list.

A foreign listed person: (1) may be removed from the list under specified conditions; (2) is ineligible to enter or be admitted to the United States, or (3) if in the United States, shall have his or her visa revoked and be removed.

 The State Department and the Department of Homeland Security may waive such prohibition if such waiver is in U.S. national security interests or is necessary for compliance with the Agreement between the United Nations (U.N.) and the United States regarding the U.N. Headquarters. Congressional notification is required prior to any such waiver.

The Assistant Secretary for Democracy, Human Rights and Labor shall designate a senior officer or officers to track violence, criminalization, and restrictions on fundamental freedoms in foreign countries based on actual or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity.

The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 is amended to require the annual country reports on human rights practices to include information on sexual orientation or gender identity violence or restrictions.</summary>
