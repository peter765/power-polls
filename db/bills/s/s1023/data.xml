This bill renames the Tropical Forest Conservation Act of 1998 as the Tropical Forest Conservation Reauthorization Act of 2017.

Non-tropical forests and coral reef ecosystems are included within the scope of, and made eligible for benefits under, the Tropical Forest Conservation Reauthorization Act of 2017.

The Tropical Forest Facility is renamed the Conservation Facility.

One or more individuals appointed by the U.S. government may serve on oversight bodies for grants from a debt-for-nature swap or debt buyback regardless of whether the United States is a party to any agreement between the eligible purchaser and the government of the beneficiary country.

The Tropical Forest Fund is renamed the Conservation Fund.

A grant of more than $250,000 from a fund must be approved by the U.S. government and the government of the beneficiary country.

The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 is amended to revise International Monetary Fund criteria for country eligibility.</summary>
