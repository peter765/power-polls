The specified activities include: (1) providing certain information or assistance to federal agencies or Congress; and (2) testifying, participating in, or otherwise assisting in IRS actions.\n\nThe bill also specifies: (1) enforcement actions that may be brought before the Department of Labor or in federal court to enforce the laws against retaliation, (2) procedures that apply to the actions, and (3) remedies that must be provided to employees that prevail in the actions."
