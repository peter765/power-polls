In the case of a hospital with an approved FTE resident amount based on the training of no more than 1.0 FTE resident in a cost reporting period before October 1, 1997, or 3.0 FTE residents in a cost reporting period after that date, CMS shall provide the hospital an opportunity to have its FTE resident amount reestablished when the hospital begins\u00a0training FTE residents\u00a0in excess of\u00a0the\u00a0applicable threshold.\n\nCurrent law limits the number, subject to\u00a0the application of\u00a0certain adjustments,\u00a0of FTE residents a hospital may have in allopathic and osteopathic medicine for purposes of Medicare payment. The bill specifies that CMS shall determine a hospital's\u00a0limitation\u00a0adjustment only after determining that the hospital's medical residency training program trains\u00a0more than 1.0 FTE residents in a cost reporting period. In the case of a hospital with a limitation adjustment based on the training of no more than 1.0 FTE resident in a cost reporting period before October 1, 1997, or 3.0 FTE residents in a cost reporting period after that date, CMS shall provide the hospital an opportunity to have its\u00a0adjustment re-determined\u00a0when the hospital begins\u00a0training FTE residents\u00a0in excess of\u00a0the\u00a0applicable threshold."
