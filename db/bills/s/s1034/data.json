The bill also provides for status adjustment of such an individual's qualifying spouse and child.\n\nThe bill enumerates: (1) grounds for revocation of blue card status or denial of permanent resident status, (2) protections for aliens apprehended before or during the application period or in removal proceedings, and (3) employer protections.\n\n Such an individual: (1) is ineligible for any federal means-tested benefit, and (2) may correct certain social security records.\n\nDHS shall report to Congress, after six months and annually for the next eight years, on the blue card program."
