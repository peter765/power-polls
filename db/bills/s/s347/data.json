For loans exceeding this amount, the fee shall be 50% of the guarantee fee that the SBA would otherwise collect for the loan.\n\nThe SBA must provide training to small manufacturers in obtaining SBA assistance, including on the application process and partnering with participating lenders.\n\nThis bill authorizes the SBA and its partners to establish partnerships to facilitate outreach to small manufacturers with respect to the application process for SBA loan guarantees.\n\nA state or local development company's debenture issued to a small manufacturer for an SBA loan guarantee may not exceed 50% of the project's cost, subject to certain exceptions."
