The NCCIC's\u00a0privacy and civil liberties training must include:\u00a0(1) reasonable limits on the receipt, retention, use, and disclosure of information associated with specific persons that is not necessary for cybersecurity purposes; (2) data integrity standards requiring the prompt removal and destruction of obsolete or erroneous names and personal information that is unrelated to the risk or incident information; (3) safeguards and confidentiality protections for\u00a0cyber threat indicators and defensive measures, including information that is proprietary or business-sensitive that may be used to identify specific persons from unauthorized access or acquisition; and (4) methods to ensure that obtained information is used only to address cybersecurity risks and threats or as specifically authorized by law.\n\nThe NCCIC must seek feedback from state and local governments on the effectiveness of such activities and provide such information to Congress."
