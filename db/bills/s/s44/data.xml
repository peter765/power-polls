 This bill amends the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to prohibit an employer from discriminating against an employee who inquires about, discusses, or discloses the wages of the employee or another employee. This protection does not apply to an employee who has access to wage information as part of the employee's essential job functions, unless the disclosure is in response to a sex discrimination complaint or charge, or in furtherance of a sex discrimination investigation, proceeding, hearing, or action, including an investigation conducted by the employer.</summary>
