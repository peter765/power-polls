The plan shall include, among other things, a description of the progress made in meeting NextGen performance goals relative to the performance metrics.\n\nThe bill revises requirements for the award of bonuses to the FAA Chief NextGen Officer. The FAA, for purposes of the award of such bonuses, shall also consider any progress made toward meeting the NextGen performance goals.\n\nThe bill revises certain performance goals set forth in the annual performance agreement between the FAA and the NextGen Officer to include quantifiable NextGen airspace efficiency, productivity, capacity, and safety performance objectives."
