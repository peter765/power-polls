  <summary date="2017-02-13T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Taking Account of Institutions with Low Operation Risk Act of 2017 or the TAILOR Act of 2017

This bill requires federal financial regulatory agencies to: (1)&#160;in general, tailor a regulatory action so as to limit the regulatory&#160;impact and other burdens on the institutions involved, with consideration of the risk profiles and business models of those institutions; and (2) report to Congress on specific actions taken to do so, as well as on other related issues.

The bill's requirements apply not only to future regulatory actions but also to regulations adopted on or after July 21, 2010.</summary>
