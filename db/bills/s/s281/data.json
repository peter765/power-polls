The bill sets forth the following per country distribution rules: (1) for transition period visas, not more than 25% of the total number of EB-2 and EB-3 visas for natives of a single country; and (2) for non-transition period visas, not more than 85% of EB-2 and EB-3 visas for natives of a single country.\n\nAmendments made by this bill shall take place as if enacted on September 30, 2016, and shall apply beginning in FY2017."
