This bill amends the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2010 to make it a key U.S. objective to achieve human exploration of Mars, including the establishment of a capability to extend human presence to the surface of Mars. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) shall report a strategy to achieve such objective through a series of successive, sustainable, free-standing, but complementary missions making robust use of cislunar space and employing the Space Launch System, Orion crew capsule, and other capabilities provided under specified titles of the Act.

NASA shall arrange with the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to review and comment on each interim report on the strategy and identify matters the NAS agrees with and matters raising NAS concerns, as well as any NAS recommendations.</summary>
