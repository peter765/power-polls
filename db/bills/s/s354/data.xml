This bill amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to eliminate the diversity immigrant visa category.

The fiscal year limit for refugee admissions is set at 50,000.

The President shall annually enumerate the previous year's number of asylees.

The bill defines: (1) "immediate relative" as the under-21 year old child or spouse of a U.S. citizen, and (2) "family-sponsored immigrant" as the under-21 year old child or spouse of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.

The worldwide fiscal year level for family-sponsored immigrants is reduced.

The bill establishes a nonimmigrant alien W-visa for the parent of an adult (at least 21 years old) U.S. citizen.</summary>
