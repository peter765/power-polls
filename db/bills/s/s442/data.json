    "text": "(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The expanded summary of the Senate passed version is repeated here.)\n\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration Transition Authorization Act of 2017\n\nTITLE I--AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS\n\n(Sec. 101) This bill authorizes appropriations to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for FY2017 for:\n\n exploration; space operations; science; aeronautics; space technology; education; safety, security, and mission services; construction and environmental compliance and restoration; and the NASA Inspector General. TITLE II--SUSTAINING NATIONAL SPACE COMMITMENTS\n\n(Sec. 201) The bill expresses the sense of Congress that NASA should be a multi-mission space agency and should have a balanced and robust set of core missions in space science, space technology, aeronautics, human space flight and exploration, and education.\n\nTITLE III--MAXIMIZING UTILIZATION OF THE ISS AND LOW-EARTH ORBIT\n\n(Sec. 301) The bill states that the primary objectives of the International Space Station (ISS) program shall be to:\n\n achieve the long-term goal and objectives for human space flight and exploration as specified in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2010, and pursue a research program that advances knowledge and provides other benefits to the nation. The bill restates that it shall be U.S. policy, in consultation with its international partners in the ISS program, to support full and complete utilization of the ISS through at least 2024.\n\nIn furthering such policy, NASA shall:\n\n pursue international, commercial, and intragovernmental means to maximize ISS logistics supply, maintenance, and operational capabilities, reduce risks to ISS systems sustainability, and offset and minimize U.S. operations costs relating to the ISS; utilize the ISS for the development of capabilities and technologies needed for the future of human space exploration beyond low-Earth orbit; and utilize the ISS for Science Mission Directorate missions in low-Earth orbit. (Sec. 302) It is the sense of Congress that:\n\n NASA should build upon the success of the Commercial Orbital Transportation Services and Commercial Resupply Services programs that have allowed private sector companies to partner with NASA to deliver cargo and scientific experiments to the ISS since 2012, and the 21st Century Launch Complex Program should be continued so as to leverage state and private investments to achieve such program's goals. Congress reaffirms:\n\n its commitment to the use of a commercially developed, private sector launch and delivery system to the ISS for crew missions; and the requirement that NASA shall make use of U.S. commercially provided ISS crew transfer and crew rescue services. The federal government may not acquire human space flight transportation services from a foreign entity unless:\n\n there is no U.S. government-operated human space flight capability available, there is no U.S. commercial provider available, and it is a qualified foreign entity. The bill declares that nothing in this section shall prevent NASA from negotiating or entering into human space flight transportation arrangements with foreign entities to ensure safety of flight and continued ISS operations.\n\nThe bill states that the objective of the Commercial Crew Program shall be to assist in the development and certification of commercially provided transportation that can: (1) carry U.S. government astronauts safely, reliably, and affordably to and from the ISS; (2) serve as a crew rescue vehicle; and (3) accomplish those goals as soon as practicable. Such objective shall be the primary consideration in the acquisition strategy for such program.\n\nNASA shall protect the safety of government astronauts by ensuring that each commercially provided transportation system under the Commercial Crew Program meets all applicable human rating requirements under specified federal law.\n\nConsistent with the findings and recommendations of the Columbia Accident Investigation Board, NASA shall ensure that safety and the minimization of the probability of loss of crew are the critical priorities of such program.\n\nNASA shall strive through the competitive selection process to minimize the life cycle cost to NASA through the planned period of commercially provided crew transportation services.\n\nThe Commercial Orbital Transportation Services Program is renamed the Commercial Resupply Services Program.\n\nThe bill declares that it is U.S. policy that, in order to foster the competitive development, operation, improvement, and commercial availability of space transportation services, and to minimize the life cycle cost to NASA, NASA shall procure services for federal government access to and return from the ISS by fair and open competition for well-defined, milestone-based, Federal Acquisition Regulation-based contracts.\n\nNASA shall, in a manner that does not add costs or schedule delays to the Commercial Crew and Commercial Resupply Services programs, ensure that all providers of such programs furnish evidence-based support for their costs and schedules.\n\nNASA shall submit to Congress a report:\n\n identifying the lessons learned to date from previous and existing Commercial Resupply Services contracts, indicating whether changes are needed as to the manner in which NASA procures and manages similar services prior to the issuance of future Commercial Resupply Services procurement opportunities, and identifying any lessons learned from the Commercial Resupply Services contracts that should be applied to the procurement and management of commercially provided crew transfer services to and from the ISS or to other future procurements. (Sec. 303) NASA shall develop a plan for transitioning the ISS from the current regime that relies heavily on NASA sponsorship to a regime where NASA could be one of many customers of a low-Earth orbit non-governmental human space flight enterprise.\n\nNASA shall submit biennial reports until 2023 which include:\n\n a description of the progress NASA is making in achieving its deep space human exploration objectives on the ISS and prospects for accomplishing future mission requirements, space exploration objectives, and other research objectives on future commercially supplied low-Earth orbit platforms or migration of those objectives to cis-lunar space; steps NASA is taking and will take, including demonstrations that could be conducted on the ISS, to stimulate and facilitate commercial demand and supply of products and services in low-Earth orbit; identification of barriers preventing the commercialization of low-Earth orbit; the cost estimates for extending operations of the ISS to 2024, 2028, and 2030; evaluation of the feasible and preferred service life of the ISS beyond September 30, 2024, through at least 2028, as a unique scientific, commercial, and exploration-related facility; and the impact on deep space exploration capabilities, including a crewed mission to Mars in the 2030s, if the preferred service life of the ISS is extended beyond 2024 and NASA maintains a flat budget profile. The bill defines \"cis-lunar space\" as the region of space from the Earth out to and including the region around the surface of the Moon.\n\nIf additional government crew, power, and transportation resources are available after meeting NASA's requirements for ISS activities as defined in the Human Exploration Roadmap to be developed pursuant to section 432 of this bill and related research, demonstrations identified in the biennial reports may:\n\n test the capabilities needed to meet future mission requirements, space exploration objectives, and other research objectives described in such reports; and demonstrate or test capabilities, including those for commercial modules or deep space habitats, Environmental Control and Life Support Systems, orbital satellite assembly, and exploration space suits. (Sec. 304) NASA shall develop a plan for meeting NASA's projected space communication and navigation needs for low-Earth orbit and deep space operations in the 20-year period following enactment of this bill.\n\nSuch plan shall include:\n\n the lifecycle cost estimates and a 5-year funding profile, the performance capabilities required to meet NASA's projected space communication and navigation needs, an identification of the projected space communications and navigation network and infrastructure needs, an identification of the projected Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System needs in the 20-year period following this bill's enactment, and the measures NASA is taking to mitigate threats to electromagnetic spectrum use. (Sec. 305) Any contract between NASA and a provider (a person that provides domestic launch or domestic reentry services to the federal government) may provide that the United States will indemnify that provider against successful claims (including reasonable expenses of litigation or settlement) by third parties for death, bodily injury, or loss of or damage to property resulting from launch services and reentry services carried out under the contract that are defined in it as unusually hazardous or nuclear in nature, but only to the extent the total amount of successful claims related to the activities under that contract:\n\n is more than the amount of insurance or demonstration of financial responsibility, and is not more than $1.5 billion (plus additional amounts necessary to reflect inflation occurring after January 1, 1989) above such insurance or financial responsibility amount. A contract made under this section that provides indemnification shall provide for:\n\n notice to the United States of any claim or suit against the provider for death, bodily injury, or loss of or damage to property; and control of or assistance in the defense by the United States, at its election, of such claim or suit and approval of any settlement. A provider that has a contract with NASA under this section shall obtain liability insurance or demonstrate financial responsibility in amounts to compensate for the maximum probable loss from claims by:\n\n a third party for death, bodily injury, or property damage or loss resulting from a launch service or reentry service carried out under the contract; and the federal government for damage or loss to government property resulting from a launch service or reentry service carried out under such contract. NASA shall determine maximum probable losses within 90 days of the provider requesting such a determination and submitting all of the information that NASA requires. NASA may revise such a determination based on new information.\n\nFor the total claims related to one launch or reentry, a provider shall not be required to obtain insurance or demonstrate financial responsibility of more than:\n\n $500 million with respect to a third party, or $100 million with respect to the federal government; or the maximum liability insurance available on the world market at reasonable cost. An insurance policy or demonstration of financial responsibility regarding this section shall protect to the extent of their potential liability for involvement in launch services or reentry services the federal government, its personnel and related entities, related entities of the provider, and government astronauts.\n\nNASA may not indemnify a provider under this section until there is a cross-waiver between NASA and the provider.\n\nThe bill states that NASA shall reciprocally waive claims with a provider under which each party agrees to be responsible and agrees to ensure that its related entities are responsible for damage or loss to its property, or for losses resulting from any injury or death sustained by its employees or agents. Such a waiver shall apply only to the extent that the claims are more than the amount of insurance or demonstration of financial responsibility.\n\nIndemnification under this section may exclude claims that result from the willfull misconduct of the provider or its related entities.\n\nNo payment may be made under this section unless NASA or its designee certifies that the amount is just and reasonable.\n\nNASA may not provide indemnification under this section for an activity requiring a license or permit under provisions relating to commercial space launch activities.\n\nTITLE IV--ADVANCING HUMAN DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION\n\nSubtitle A--Human Space Flight and Exploration Goals and Objectives\n\n(Sec. 411) The bill states that the long-terms goals for the human space flight and exploration efforts of NASA shall be:\n\n to expand permanent human presence beyond low-Earth orbit, and to do so where practical, with the involvement of international, academic, and industry partners , crewed missions and progress toward achieving the expansion of human presence beyond low-Earth orbit to enable the potential for subsequent human exploration and the extension of human presence throughout the solar system, and to enable a capability to extend human presence, including potential human habitation on another celestial body and a thriving space economy in the 21st Century. (Sec. 412) The key U.S. objectives for human expansion into space shall include achieving human exploration of Mars and beyond through the prioritization of those technologies and capabilities best suited for such a mission in accordance with the stepping stone approach to exploration specified in federal law.\n\n (Sec. 413) NASA shall manage human space flight programs, including the Space Launch System (SLS) and the Orion multipurpose crew vehicle, to enable humans to explore Mars and other space destinations.\n\n(Sec. 414) NASA: (1) may conduct missions to intermediate destinations in order to achieve the objective of human exploration of Mars, and (2) shall incorporate any such missions into the human exploration roadmap.\n\n The bill declares that in order to maximize the cost-effectiveness of the long-term exploration and utilization activities of the United States, NASA shall take all necessary steps, including engaging international, academic, and industry partners, to ensure that activities in NASA's human exploration program balance how those activities might also help meet the requirements of future exploration and utilization activities leading to human habitation on the surface of Mars.\n\nWithin budgetary considerations, once an exploration-related project enters its development phase, NASA shall seek to complete such project without any undue delays.\n\nFurthermore, in order to achieve the goal of successfully conducting a crewed mission to the surface of Mars, the President may invite U.S. partners in the ISS program and other nations, as appropriate, to participate in an international initiative under the leadership of the United States.\n\n(Sec. 415) NASA shall implement an exploration research and technology development program for enabling human and robotic operations.\n\n(Sec. 417) The bill declares that in order to ensure continuous U.S. participation and leadership in the exploration and use of space and as an essential instrument of national security, it is U.S. policy to maintain uninterrupted capability for human space flight and operations:\n\n in low-Earth orbit; and beyond low-Earth orbit once the capabilities described in section 421 of this bill become available. NASA shall submit annual reports to Congress which describe the progress being made toward the development of the SLS and Orion.\n\nSubtitle B--Assuring Core Capabilities for Exploration\n\n(Sec. 421) Congress reaffirms the policy and minimum capability requirements for the SLS.\n\nNASA should budget for and undertake a ground test and uncrewed and crewed flight test and demonstration program for the SLS and Orion in order to promote safety and reduce programmatic risk.\n\nNASA shall continue the development of the fully integrated SLS, including an upper stage needed to go beyond low-Earth orbit, in order to safely enable human space exploration of the Moon, Mars, and beyond over the course of the next century.\n\nWithin 60 days of enactment of this bill, NASA shall submit to Congress a report that addresses the ability of Orion to meet the requirement specified in federal law that it be designed to have, at a minimum, the capability to provide an alternative means of delivery of crew and cargo to the ISS in the event that other vehicles, whether commercial vehicles or partner-supplied vehicles, are unable to perform that function. Such report shall detail:\n\n those components and systems of Orion which ensure that it is in compliance with such minimum capability requirement; the expected date that Orion, integrated with a vehicle other than the SLS, could be available to transport crew and cargo to the ISS; any impacts to the deep space exploration missions NASA shall continue development of pursuant to this section which are due to enabling Orion in meeting such minimum capability requirement and conducting such a mission to the ISS; and the overall cost and schedule impacts associated with enabling Orion in meeting such requirement and conducting such a mission. NASA shall also continue the development of:\n\n an uncrewed exploration mission to demonstrate the capability of the SLS and Orion as an integrated system by 2018; a crewed exploration mission to demonstrate the SLS, including the core stage and exploration upper stages by 2021; subsequent missions beginning with the EM-3 at operational flight rate sufficient to maintain safety and operational readiness using the SLS and Orion to extend into cis-lunar space and eventually to Mars; and a deep space habitat as a key element in a deep space exploration architecture along with the SLS and Orion. NASA shall assess the utility of the SLS for use by the science community and for other federal government launch needs, including considering the overall cost and schedule savings from reduced transit times and increased science returns enabled by the capabilities of the SLS.\n\nNASA, in consultation with the Department of Defense and the Office of National Intelligence, shall prepare a report that addresses the effort and budget required to enable and utilize a cargo variant of the 130-ton SLS configuration specified in federal law.\n\nIn preparing such report NASA shall:\n\n consider the technical requirements of the scientific and national security communities related to a cargo variant of the SLS; and assess the utility and estimated cost savings obtained by using such a cargo variant for national security and space science missions.
