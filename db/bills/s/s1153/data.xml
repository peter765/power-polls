This bill directs the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to deny or revoke eligibility to provide non-VA health care services to veterans for any any health care provider that: (1) was removed from VA employment for violating VA policy relating to the delivery of safe and appropriate health care, (2) violated medical license requirements, (3) had a VA credential revoked on grounds that impact the provider's ability to deliver safe and appropriate health care, or (4) violated a law for which a prison term of more than one year may be imposed.

The VA may deny, revoke, or suspend a health care provider's eligibility to provide non-VA health care services based on a reasonable belief that such action is necessary to immediately protect the health or safety of veterans if: (1) the provider is under investigation by a state's medical licensing board, (2) the provider has entered into a settlement agreement for a disciplinary charge relating to the practice of medicine, or (3) the VA otherwise determines that such action is appropriate.

The VA shall suspend a health care provider's eligibility to provide non-VA health care services to veterans if such provider is suspended from serving as a VA medical provider.</summary>
