Upon approval of USDA, a board may enter directly into contracts and agreements to carry out generic promotion, research, or other activities authorized by law if the agreement or contract requires records accounting for the funds received to be submitted to the board.\n\nThe board must meet specified requirements regarding the publication of budgets and disbursements of funds.\n\nThe USDA Inspector General and the Government Accountability Office must conduct specified audits regarding checkoff programs."
