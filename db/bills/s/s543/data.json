In each case of a contract that would result in the VA incurring an obligation exceeding $100 million, the VA must:\n\n ensure that the contract requires the service provider to document its work through VA information technology systems so that the VA can review and validate the quality of the service provided using the metrics set forth in the contract; use the appropriate VA project management accountability system to ensure that the contract provides an adequate return on investment; report on any failure of the service provider to meet contractual obligations, the effect of such failure, and the actions taken by the VA and by the contractor to address it; report the details of any modifications made to the contract and a justification for such modifications; and publish information about the contract and any modifications on its website."
