  <summary date="2017-03-02T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Federal Land Invasive Species Control, Prevention, and Management Act

This bill directs each agency concerned (the Department of the Interior for federal land administered through the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Bureau of Land Management, Bureau of Reclamation, National Park Service, or U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service; the Department of Agriculture [USDA] for federal land administered through the U.S. Forest Service; and any other federal agency the duties of which require planning related to, and the treatment of, invasive species on federal land) to plan and carry out activities on land directly managed by the agency concerned to control and manage invasive species in order to inhibit or reduce their populations and to effectuate restoration or reclamation efforts.

 The agency concerned shall develop a strategic plan for the implementation of an invasive species program that endeavors to achieve a substantive annual net reduction of invasive species populations or infested acreage on land managed by that agency.

 Each strategic plan shall be developed: (1) in coordination with eligible states, their political subdivisions, and federally recognized Indian tribes; and (2) according to the priorities established by at least one governor of an eligible state in which an ecosystem affected by an invasive species is located.

 The agency concerned shall prioritize the use of the least costly option necessary to perform effectively, based on sound scientific data and other commonly used cost-effective benchmarks in an area.

 Projects and activities carried out under this bill must be coordinated with affected local governments according to certain criteria regarding the development and revision of land use plans under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976.</summary>
