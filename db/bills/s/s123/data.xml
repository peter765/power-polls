This bill amends the Communications Act of 1934 to&#160;prohibit businesses from manufacturing or importing for use in the United States, or selling or leasing in the United States, a multi-line telephone system unless&#160;it can be installed to: (1) allow 9-1-1 calls to be transmitted to the appropriate public safety answering point without requiring the user to dial any additional digit, code, prefix, or post-fix (including any trunk-access code such as the digit "9"), regardless of what a user is required to dial for other calls; and (2) provide on-site notifications (if possible without any improvement to the system) so that when a person at the facility where the system is installed initiates a 9-1-1 call, the system notifies a central location at the facility or a person or organization with responsibility for safety or security for the location.

Businesses are prohibited from installing multi-line telephone systems unless, upon installation, they allow 9-1-1 calls to be initiated without dialing such additional codes.

Installers must configure such systems to provide such on-site notifications.</summary>
