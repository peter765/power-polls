Kennedy Center Reauthorization Act of 2017\n\n(Sec. 2) This bill amends the John F. Kennedy Center Act to reauthorize appropriations for FY2018-FY2021 for the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts for: (1) maintenance, repair, and security; and (2) capital projects.\n\n(Sec. 3) The bill expresses the sense of Congress that the center should: (1) recognize 2018 as the 60th anniversary of the National Cultural Center Act (now known as the John. F. Kennedy Center Act), and (2) establish commemorative displays during such year honoring the history of such Act.\n\nThe bill directs that a plaque be placed within the center that contains an inscription to commemorate such anniversary. The center must solicit private contributions for the plaque.\n\n(Sec. 4) The bill expresses the sense of Congress that the center should: (1) recognize 2021 as the 50th anniversary of its opening, and (2) commemorate its mission as a national center for the performing arts and as a national memorial to President John. F. Kennedy. The center may create displays and programs that memorialize its opening in 1971 and its programmatic legacy."
