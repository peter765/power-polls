    "text": "Lifetime Income Disclosure Act \n\nThis bill amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) to require pension benefit statements to include a lifetime income disclosure at least once during any 12-month period.\n\nThe disclosure must set forth the lifetime income stream equivalent of the total benefits accrued with respect to the participant or beneficiary. The \"lifetime income stream equivalent of the total benefits accrued\" is the amount of monthly payments the participant or beneficiary would receive if the total accrued benefits were used to provide lifetime income streams based on certain assumptions, including that the participant or beneficiary has a spouse of equal age and a single life annuity.\n\nThe Department of Labor must issue a model lifetime income disclosure, assumptions that plan administrators may use in converting total accrued benefits into lifetime income stream equivalents, and related rules.\n\nNo plan fiduciary, sponsor, or other person may be liable under ERISA solely due to the provision of lifetime income stream equivalents derived in accordance with the assumptions and related rules issued by Labor, including explanations contained in the model lifetime income disclosure."
