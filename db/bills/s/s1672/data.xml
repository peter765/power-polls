  <summary date="2017-07-31T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Incentivizing Offshore Wind Power Act

This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) allow a 30% tax credit for investment in a qualifying offshore wind facility (an offshore facility using wind to produce electricity), and (2)&#160;direct the Department of the Treasury to establish a qualifying credit for offshore wind facilities program to consider and award certifications for investments eligible for such a credit to qualifying offshore wind facility sponsors.

 The total amount of megawatt capacity for offshore facilities with respect to which credits may be allocated under the program may not exceed 3,000 megawatts.

The bill requires Treasury to review credits allocated under this bill periodically and authorizes Treasury to make additional allocations and reallocations of such credits upon determining that: (1) the limit on the total amount of megawatt capacity for offshore facilities with respect to which credits may be allocated under the program has not been attained, or (2) scheduled placed-in-service dates of previously certified facilities have been significantly delayed and the applicant for certification will not meet the required timeline.</summary>
