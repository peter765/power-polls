  <summary date="2017-02-15T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Streamlining Energy Efficiency for Schools Act

This bill amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to direct the Department of Energy (DOE), acting through the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, to act as the lead federal agency for coordinating and disseminating information on existing federal programs and assistance that may be used to help initiate, develop, and finance energy efficiency, renewable energy, and energy retrofitting projects for schools.

DOE must:

 carry out a review of existing programs and financing mechanisms available in or from appropriate federal agencies with jurisdiction over energy financing and facilitation that are currently used or may be used for such purposes; establish a federal cross-departmental collaborative coordination, education, and outreach effort to streamline communication and promote available federal opportunities and assistance for such projects that enables states, local educational agencies, and schools to use existing federal opportunities more effectively and to form partnerships with appropriate entities to support project initiation; provide technical assistance for states, local educational agencies, and schools to help develop and finance projects that meet specified requirements; develop and maintain a single online resource website with contact information for relevant technical assistance and support staff in the office for states, local educational agencies, and schools to effectively access and use federal opportunities and assistance to develop such projects; and establish a process for recognition of schools that have successfully implemented such projects and are willing to serve as resources for other local educational agencies and schools to assist initiation of similar efforts.</summary>
