(Sec.1)This bill amends the Billfish Conservation Act of 2012 to limit the sale of billfish caught by U.S. fishing vessels.

Under current law, billfish caught by U.S. vessels that land (number or poundage of fish unloaded onshore by commercial fisherman) in Hawaii or Pacific Insular Areas (American Samoa, Baker Island, Guam, Howland Island, Jarvis Island, Johnston Atoll, Kingman Reef, Midway Island, the Northern Mariana Islands, Palmyra Atoll, and Wake Island) may be sold and exported to non-U.S. markets or transported to other U.S. markets.

This bill requires billfish caught by U.S. vessels that land in Hawaii or Pacific Insular Areas to be retained for sale in those areas.</summary>
