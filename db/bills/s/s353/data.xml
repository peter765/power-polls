This bill amends the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 to extend through 2022 the rural add-on, which is a payment increase for Medicare home health services furnished to patients in rural areas.

The&#160;bill also amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to lower, for FY2018-FY2022,&#160;the annual ceiling on the home health outlier adjustment, which&#160;is a payment increase&#160;for home health services furnished to the costliest Medicare beneficiaries, from 2.5% to 2.25% of the total Medicare payments projected to be made under the prospective payment system for home health services. (Under the Medicare prospective payment system, payment is made according to a predetermined, fixed amount.)</summary>
