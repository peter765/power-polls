This bill amends the Energy Conservation and Production Act and the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to require the Department of Energy to distribute funds for the Weatherization Assistance Program and the state energy assistance program within 60 days of Congress making the funds available for such programs.

(The Weatherization Assistance Program reduces energy costs for low-income households by increasing the energy efficiency. The State Energy Program supports state energy conservation plans and energy emergency planning and response.)</summary>
