This bill amends the federal criminal code to allow a licensed gun dealer, importer, or manufacturer to sell or ship a firearm to the spouse of a member of the U.S. Armed Forces on active duty. (Current law already allows a licensed dealer, importer, or manufacturer to sell a firearm to a member of the U.S. Armed Forces on active duty.)

The bill also specifies that, for purposes of federal firearms laws, a member of the U.S. Armed Forces on active duty, or his or her spouse, is a resident of the state in which: (1) the member or spouse maintains legal residence, (2) the permanent duty station of the member is located, and (3) the member maintains a home from which he or she commutes to the permanent duty station.</summary>
