This bill amends the Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 to require the Environmental Protection Agency, in implementing the Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure rule (concerning oil pollution prevention) with respect to any farm, to:

 require certification by a professional engineer for a farm with an aggregate aboveground storage capacity of more than 42,000 gallons (currently, 20,000 gallons); allow self-certification by the owner or operator of a farm with an aggregate aboveground storage capacity of more than 10,000 gallons but less than 42,000 gallons (currently, of less than 20,000 gallons and more than the lesser of 6,000 gallons and the adjustment quantity established under such Act); and not require compliance with the rule by any farm with an aggregate aboveground storage capacity of 10,000 gallons or less (currently, of more than 2,500 gallons and less than the lesser of 6,000 gallons and such adjustment quantity). The rule&#160;shall apply&#160;to aboveground storage containers at farms on a separate parcel that have an individual capacity of not more than 1,320 gallons (currently, 1,000 gallons) and an aggregate capacity of not more than 3,000 gallons (currently, 2,500 gallons).</summary>
