  <summary date="2017-02-02T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Public Land Renewable Energy Development Act

This bill amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to extend through FY2022 the authorization for deposit and use of lease revenues under the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970. Such funds shall be available to the Department of the Interior for FY2017 and afterwards to implement both the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970.

 Interior shall establish priority areas on covered land (i.e., public land administered by Interior and not excluded under law from the development of geothermal, solar, or wind energy) for geothermal, solar, and wind energy projects. Variance areas shall also be considered for the development of renewable energy projects under this bill, consistent with the principles of multiple use (as defined under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976).

The bill defines "variance area" as covered land that is neither an exclusion area (not suitable for development of renewable energy projects) nor a priority area.

 Interior shall establish a program to improve federal permit coordination with respect to renewable energy projects carried out on covered land.

 The bill establishes the Renewable Energy Resource Conservation Fund to make funds available to federal, state, and tribal agencies for distribution in regions in which renewable energy projects are located on federal land for: (1) restoring and protecting fish and wildlife habitat and corridors for affected species and water resources in areas affected by wind, geothermal, or solar energy development; and (2) preserving and improving recreational access to federal land and water in an affected region.</summary>
