This bill directs the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to convey certain federal land in two phases to the Alaska Mental Health Trust Authority in exchange for certain nonfederal land. Before completing each phase of the land exchange, USDA shall complete any necessary land surveys and required pre-exchange clearances, mitigation activities, and approvals related to:

 threatened and endangered species, cultural and historic resources, wetland and floodplains, and hazardous materials. Upon acquisition by USDA, the nonfederal land shall become part of Tongass National Forest, and shall be withdrawn from:
