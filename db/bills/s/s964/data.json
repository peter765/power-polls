(Currently, common carriers regulated under the Communications Act are exempt from the FTC's enforcement authority and nonprofit organizations are subject to FTC enforcement only if they provide substantial economic benefit to their for-profit members.)\n\nA state may bring a civil action in federal court to enforce such prohibition."
