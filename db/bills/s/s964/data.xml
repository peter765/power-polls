This bill prohibits providers of Internet broadband services or of Internet content, applications, or devices from using unfair or deceptive acts or practices relating to privacy or data security.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC), after consulting with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), may promulgate regulations to carry out such prohibition.

The FTC may also enforce this bill against common carriers regulated by the FCC under the Communications Act of 1934 and nonprofit organizations. (Currently, common carriers regulated under the Communications Act are exempt from the FTC's enforcement authority and nonprofit organizations are subject to FTC enforcement only if they provide substantial economic benefit to their for-profit members.)

A state may bring a civil action in federal court to enforce such prohibition.</summary>
