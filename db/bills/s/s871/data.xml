This bill provides appropriations for military pay and allowances during a funding gap impacting the Armed Forces.

Under the bill, a "funding gap" is any period of time after the beginning of a fiscal year for which interim or full-year appropriations for the personnel accounts of the Armed Forces for that fiscal year have not been enacted.

 If a funding gap occurs, the bill provides appropriations for the Department of Defense (DOD) and the Department of Homeland Security (in the case of the Coast Guard) to continue to provide pay and allowances (without interruption) to:

 members of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard, including reserve components, who perform active service during the funding gap; at the discretion of DOD, civilian DOD personnel who are providing support to the members of the Armed Forces who perform active service during the funding gap; and at the discretion of DOD, personnel of DOD contractors who are providing direct support to the members of the Armed Forces who perform active service during the funding gap.</summary>
