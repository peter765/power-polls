After the third, fourth, and fifth years of the project, CMS shall pay a performance incentive payment to each participating practice that meets or exceeds performance standards developed by CMS.\n\nCMS shall assess the performance of each participating oncology practice annually. Performance standards shall address: (1) specified measures related to patient care, resource utilization, survivorship, and end-of-life care; and (2) the patient experience of care, as reflected in surveys submitted by each practice. CMS shall also assess the extent to which a practice has used breakthrough or other best-in-class therapies.\n\nTo the extent practicable, CMS shall select practices of varying sizes and geographic areas for participation."
