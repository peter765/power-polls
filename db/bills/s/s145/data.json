    "text": "National Strategic and Critical Minerals Production Act\n\nThis bill addresses the mine permitting process.\n\nUnder the bill, projects that provide minerals vital to job creation, energy infrastructure, American economic competitiveness, and national security must be considered to be \"infrastructure projects\" as described in Executive Order 13604, entitled \"Improving Performance of Federal Permitting and Review of Infrastructure Projects\" dated March 22, 2012.This order directed federal agencies to significantly reduce the time required to make permitting and review decisions on infrastructure projects.\n\nThe bill sets forth general requirements for an existing mineral exploration or mine permit application.\n\nThe Bureau of Land Management (BLM)or the Forest Service shall appoint a project lead for the mine permitting process to coordinate with other agencies to ensure that the agencies: minimize delays, set and adhere to timelines for completion of the permitting process, set clear permitting goals, and track progress against goals.\n\nThe requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969are satisfied if the BLM or the Forest Service determines that the agency issuing the permit will address specified factors, such as environmental impact, alternatives to issuance of the permit, or any irreversible and irretrievable commitment of resources that would be involved in the proposed action. The time period for completion of the mine permitting review process shall not exceed 30 months, except by mutual agreement.\n\nProjects on National Forest System land shall be exempt from regulations that prohibit timber tree cutting and road construction in areas without roads.\n\nThe bill does not apply to oil, gas, and potash leasing and development within the designated potash areas of Eddy and Lea Counties, New Mexico."
