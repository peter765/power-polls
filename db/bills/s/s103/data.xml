This bill nullifies:

 the final Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) rule entitled "Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing" and any successor rule substantially similar to it, and the notice relating to the Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing Assessment Tool and any successor notice or rule substantially similar to it. No federal funds may be used to design, build, maintain, utilize, or provide access to a federal database of geospatial information on community racial disparities or disparities in access to affordable housing.

HUD is required to: (1) consult with state, local government, and public housing agency officials to develop recommendations, consistent with applicable rulings of the U.S. Supreme Court, to further the Fair Housing Act's purposes and policies; and (2) make a final report publicly available online within 12 months after enactment of this bill.</summary>
