Prohibitions pertaining to contracts entered into by Members of Congress are extended to contracts by the President or Vice President.\n\nThe bill amends the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 to require the disclosure of tax returns by the incumbent President and presidential nominees of a major political party for the three most recent taxable years.\n\nThe bill declares the sense of Congress that a violation of divestiture requirements of this bill or the Ethics in Government in Government Act of 1978 by the President or the Vice President would constitute a high crime or misdemeanor."
