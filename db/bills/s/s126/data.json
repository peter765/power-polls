A federal agency may not accept such a driver's license or identification card issued more than two years after promulgation of such standards unless it conforms with such standards.\n\nEach state shall certify to DOT that the state is in compliance with such standards. DOT shall award grants to assist states to conform driver's licenses and identification cards to such standards."
